  "description": "Java 9 has added a new Checksum method that can makes uses of ByteBuffer(s) (see Java 9's Checksum::update): Kafka already provides specific support for Java 9's Cr32C, hence it makes sense it's going to use the most optimized version of it for direct ByteBuffers as well (read-only or not), instead of performing a byte-per-byte computation. I'm aware that currently the client's Buffer pools aren't using direct ByteBuffer, but having full support for it can open the door to future interesting optimizations on it."
