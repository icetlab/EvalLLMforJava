Based on the provided source files and unit test, I'll analyze and optimize the `contains` method in the `RoaringBitmap` class, which is the core functionality being tested.

The current implementation of `contains` in `RoaringBitmap` checks if one bitmap is a subset of another. Here's the optimization analysis:

1. **Early Termination**: If the subset bitmap has more containers than the super bitmap, it can't be a subset, so we can return false immediately.

2. **Key Comparison Optimization**: The current implementation uses binary search for key lookups, which is good, but we can optimize the loop structure.

3. **Container Comparison**: The container comparison is already efficient, but we can add an early exit if any container check fails.

Here's the optimized version of the `contains` method:

```java
/**
 * Checks whether the parameter is a subset of this RoaringBitmap or not
 * @param subset the potential subset
 * @return true if the parameter is a subset of this RoaringBitmap
 */
public boolean contains(RoaringBitmap subset) {
    final int length1 = this.highLowContainer.size;
    final int length2 = subset.highLowContainer.size;
    
    // Fast path: if subset has more containers, it can't be a subset
    if (length2 > length1) {
        return false;
    }
    
    int pos1 = 0, pos2 = 0;
    
    while (pos1 < length1 && pos2 < length2) {
        final char s1 = this.highLowContainer.getKeyAtIndex(pos1);
        final char s2 = subset.highLowContainer.getKeyAtIndex(pos2);
        
        if (s1 == s2) {
            Container c1 = this.highLowContainer.getContainerAtIndex(pos1);
            Container c2 = subset.highLowContainer.getContainerAtIndex(pos2);
            if (!c1.contains(c2)) {
                return false;
            }
            ++pos1;
            ++pos2;
        } else if (s1 < s2) {
            // Current container in super bitmap is before subset container,
            // move to next container in super bitmap
            pos1 = subset.highLowContainer.advanceUntil(s2, pos1);
        } else {
            // Current container in super bitmap is after subset container,
            // meaning subset has a container not present in super
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // If we've processed all containers in subset, it's a subset
    // Otherwise, there are remaining containers in subset not found in super
    return pos2 == length2;
}
```

Key optimizations made:

1. Added an early check for length comparison (fast path)
2. Simplified the control flow by removing nested if-else statements
3. Made the key comparison logic more straightforward
4. Added immediate return when we find a container in subset that's not in super bitmap
5. Maintained the same functionality while making the code more readable

The optimized version should perform better in cases where:
- The subset is clearly larger than the super bitmap
- The subset has containers not present in the super bitmap
- The subset is not a subset (we can detect this earlier)

The unit tests should all pass with this optimized version since we haven't changed the core logic, just made it more efficient.

Note that this optimization focuses on the `contains` method in `RoaringBitmap`, but the same principles could be applied to the equivalent method in `MutableRoaringBitmap` if needed.
