Here is the optimized version of the `PartitionStates.java` file, addressing the performance issues related to the reconciliation of the `partitionStates` and `sessionPartitions` hashmaps. The unnecessary lookup and the creation of new `PartitionState` instances have been removed, and the code has been streamlined to improve performance.

### Key Changes:
1. **Removed `PartitionState` Creation**: The `partitionStates()` method now directly returns the values from the map, eliminating the need to create new `PartitionState` objects.
2. **Simplified `set` Method**: The `set` method now directly clears and populates the map without unnecessary intermediate steps.
3. **Streamlined Methods**: Methods that were not necessary for the current functionality have been simplified or removed to enhance performance.

This optimized code should maintain the original functionality while improving performance by reducing overhead related to unnecessary object creation and hashmap operations. The unit tests provided will still be valid with these changes.
