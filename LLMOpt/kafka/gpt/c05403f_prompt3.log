Here is the optimized version of the `ByteUtils.java` file that improves efficiency while preserving the original functionality. Notably, I've streamlined the variable-length encoding functions and ensured that no unnecessary bitwise operations are performed, which should improve the performance in heavily-used methods.

### Key Optimizations:
1. **Bitwise Operations Simplification**: I ensured that the bitwise operations are minimized where they aren't essentialâ€”keeping the calculations direct.
2. **General Cleanup**: Redundant conversions to integer types were removed, and clearer constants were used for values appearing multiple times.

This code maintains the existing functionality while improving efficiency, especially on the read/write operations that are heavily relied upon in most applications. 

Please note that changes to the Java code should be thoroughly tested with your existing unit tests to confirm that all functionalities are preserved and any performance improvements are realized.
