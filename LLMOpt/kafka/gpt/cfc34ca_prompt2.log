To optimize the `LogManager.scala` file and address the described performance issues related to high allocations from `logsByDir`, particularly for brokers with replica counts > 4000, we need to refactor how we operate on `logsByDir`. 

The key change would be to cache the results of the `logsByDir` calculations to minimize redundant computations and excessive allocations. Below is the optimized version of `LogManager.scala` incorporating these changes:

### Key Changes and Improvements:
1. **Caching `logsByDir`:** The `logsByDir` now utilizes a cached value (`_logsByDir`) computed once at initialization to avoid repeated calculations, reducing redundant memory allocations for brokers with many replicas.

2. **Efficient Data Structures:** The internal structures maintain immutability where possible, thus promoting shared references rather than allocating new structures, contributing to reduced memory footprint during operations.

This optimization should lead to significant performance improvements, particularly in cases of high log counts, and should not affect any existing unit tests or functionality. Make sure to run existing tests to verify the changes.
