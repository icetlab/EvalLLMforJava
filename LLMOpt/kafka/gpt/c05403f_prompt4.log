Here is the optimized version of the `ByteUtils.java` file, focusing on improving the performance of the `sizeOfUnsignedVarint` and `sizeOfVarlong` methods by replacing the iterative while loops with a more efficient calculation.

### Changes Made:
1. **Optimized `sizeOfUnsignedVarint`**: The method now uses bit manipulation to determine how many bytes are needed to represent the integer in variable-length format without iterating through the bits.
2. **Optimized `sizeOfVarlong`**: Similar to the above, this method uses bit manipulation to efficiently calculate the number of bytes required for a long value in variable-length format.

These optimizations should improve the performance of the Kafka Java client producer path that relies on these size calculations. The original functionality is preserved, and the unit tests provided should still pass without any modifications.
