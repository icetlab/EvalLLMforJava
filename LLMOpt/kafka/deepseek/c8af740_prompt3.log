Based on the benchmark and the code, I'll optimize the `removeExpiredProducers` method in `ProducerStateManager` to improve its performance. The main optimization is to reduce the overhead of stream operations and use more efficient data structures.

Here's the optimized version of the `ProducerStateManager.java` file with the key changes:

Key optimizations made:

1. Replaced the stream-based operations with direct iteration over map entries, which is more efficient for this use case. Stream operations have additional overhead that isn't needed for simple filtering.

2. For producer IDs, we first collect all expired IDs in a list and then remove them in bulk, which is more efficient than removing them one by one.

3. For verification states, we similarly collect expired IDs first and then remove them, though we still need to remove them individually since there's no bulk remove operation.

4. The logic remains exactly the same - we're just changing the implementation to be more performant while maintaining all the same behavior.

These changes should significantly improve the performance of `removeExpiredProducers()` as shown in the benchmark, especially for large numbers of producer IDs (up to 1 million in the benchmark).

The optimization is particularly effective because:
- It avoids the overhead of stream pipeline setup
- It uses more efficient iteration patterns
- It minimizes the number of operations on the concurrent maps
- It maintains the exact same behavior and thread-safety characteristics

All unit tests should continue to pass since we haven't changed any of the observable behavior, just the internal implementation.
