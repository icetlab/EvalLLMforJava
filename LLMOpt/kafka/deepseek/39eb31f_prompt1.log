I'll analyze the code and suggest optimizations while maintaining functionality and passing all tests. Here's the optimized version of `Topic.java`:

Key optimizations made:

1. In `validate()`:
   - Combined the "." and ".." checks into a single length check
   - Removed the redundant `containsValidPattern()` call and used the pattern matcher directly
   - Stored topic length in a variable to avoid multiple calls to `length()`

2. In `hasCollisionChars()`:
   - Replaced `contains()` with `indexOf()` which is slightly more efficient for single character checks

3. In `hasCollision()`:
   - Added a length check first to quickly eliminate non-matching strings
   - Implemented a character-by-character comparison instead of string replacement and equals
   - This avoids creating new string objects and is more efficient for longer topic names

4. General improvements:
   - Added braces for single-line if statements for better readability and maintainability
   - Removed redundant method `containsValidPattern()` since it was only used once

The optimized version maintains all the original functionality while being more efficient, especially for the collision detection and validation operations that would be called frequently in a Kafka client. All unit tests should continue to pass as the behavior remains identical.

The most significant performance improvement is in the `hasCollision()` method, which now avoids string allocations and performs a single pass comparison. This is particularly beneficial since topic name comparisons are likely a frequent operation in Kafka's internals.
