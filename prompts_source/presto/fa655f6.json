  "description": "When seeking a key represented in Slice format, the comparison of the key value and the value in the SingleMapBlock at the position of the hashCode was done through keyBlockNativeEquals.invokeExact(), which creates a new Slice object. When there are many map subscript operations in a query, many small Slice objects are created and this causes high GC overhead which may lead to reliability problems."
