My analysis of the `EpollEventLoop` reveals a performance optimization opportunity within the `epollWait` method. This method is responsible for calculating the timeout for the native `epoll_wait` call, which is based on the deadline of the next scheduled task.

The original implementation first calls `deadlineNanos()` to retrieve the deadline of the next scheduled task. If this deadline has changed since the last check, it then calls `delayNanos()` to compute the timeout. However, the `delayNanos()` method, as implemented in `SingleThreadEventLoop`, also retrieves the deadline of the next scheduled task internally. This results in a redundant call to `peekScheduledTask()`, which can introduce unnecessary overhead in the event loop's hot path.

My proposed change eliminates this redundancy. Instead of calling `delayNanos()`, I will inline its logic within `epollWait`. This allows reusing the `curDeadlineNanos` value that has already been fetched, thus avoiding the second call to `peekScheduledTask()`. This optimization reduces the work done in each iteration of the event loop, which should improve performance, particularly when tasks are being scheduled.
