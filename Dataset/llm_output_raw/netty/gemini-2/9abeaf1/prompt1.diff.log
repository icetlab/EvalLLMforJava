My optimization focuses on the `epollWait` method within the `EpollEventLoop`, which is a critical hot path. The original implementation for calculating the timeout for `epoll_wait` involved several arithmetic operations, including multiple `min` calls, division, multiplication, and subtraction. I've simplified this logic by pre-calculating seconds and nanoseconds from the total delay. This new approach uses a more direct calculation, reducing the number of operations and comparisons. This change maintains the correctness of handling large timeout values (up to `Long.MAX_VALUE`) and negative delays (for overdue tasks) while improving performance by making the timeout calculation more efficient.
