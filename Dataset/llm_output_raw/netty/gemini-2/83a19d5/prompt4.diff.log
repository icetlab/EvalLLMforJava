The core performance issue is contention on the reference count field, which is updated using a compare-and-set (CAS) loop. Under high contention from multiple threads frequently retaining and releasing the same object, this CAS loop can lead to significant CPU consumption due to repeated failed attempts.

To improve this, I will replace the CAS loop with a single `getAndAdd` atomic operation. This operation is often more efficient under contention as it's typically implemented with a single hardware instruction (like `lock xadd` on x86) rather than a loop.

The new approach involves atomically adding the increment (or decrement) and then checking if the operation was valid based on the *previous* reference count value. The checks for overflow, resurrection (retaining a deallocated object), and double-free (releasing more than the current reference count) are preserved. In the rare case that an invalid operation is detected, the change to the reference count is reverted by another `getAndAdd` operation, and an exception is thrown, maintaining the original behavior of signaling errors. This change is applied to both `AbstractReferenceCountedByteBuf` and `AbstractReferenceCounted` classes, as they share the same reference counting implementation pattern.
