My proposed improvements focus on optimizing the hot paths within the `Recycler` class.

First, I've refactored the `get()` method to prioritize the fast-path logic. By checking for a pooled object and returning it immediately, we can reduce branching and improve instruction pipeline efficiency for the most common scenario. The slower path of creating a new object is handled afterward.

Second, I've optimized the state management within the internal `DefaultHandle` class.
1.  In the `toClaimed()` method, which is called on the thread-local hot path, the volatile write is replaced with a `lazySet`. This is a more relaxed and potentially faster write operation, which is safe in this context because the state change does not need to be immediately visible to other threads.
2.  In the `toAvailable()` method, which is called when an object is recycled, the `getAndSet` operation is replaced with a more direct `compareAndSet`. This change more clearly expresses the intended atomic operation (transitioning from `CLAIMED` to `AVAILABLE`) and can be more performant on some architectures.

These changes collectively aim to reduce overhead in object recycling, improving overall application performance.
