My proposed changes focus on improving the performance and correctness of the `Recycler`.

First, I will address a race condition in the `unguardedRecycle` path. The original implementation used a non-atomic check-then-act pattern to update the state of a recycled object, which could lead to the same object being recycled multiple times under concurrent access. I will replace this with an atomic `compareAndSet` operation to ensure thread safety and prevent this critical bug.

Second, I will optimize the `isTerminated` check for `LocalPool` owner threads. The current implementation uses `Thread.getState()`, which can be a costly operation, with a special case for J9 VMs. By switching to `Thread.isAlive()`, which is functionally equivalent in this context but significantly more performant, we can achieve a speedup on all JVMs.
