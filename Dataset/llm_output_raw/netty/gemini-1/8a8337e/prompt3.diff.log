My overall improvement strategy focuses on two key areas of the `Recycler` implementation to enhance its performance, especially in high-contention scenarios.

First, I will refactor the `get()` method. The original implementation had a somewhat complex structure with a single return point. By restructuring it to handle the hot path (retrieving an object from the pool) with an early return, the code becomes more readable and potentially more efficient, as the most common execution path is shortened.

Second, I will optimize the `DefaultHandle.toAvailable()` method, which is called during object recycling. The original implementation used `getAndSet` for atomically updating the handle's state. I will replace this with `compareAndSet`. This change is beneficial because `compareAndSet` is often more performant, especially on modern hardware, and it more clearly expresses the intended state transition logic for preventing double recycling.

These changes are designed to reduce overhead in the object recycling lifecycle, improving throughput and reducing latency.
