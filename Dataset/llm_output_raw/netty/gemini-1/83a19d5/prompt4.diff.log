The primary performance issue is contention on the reference count field (`refCnt`) in `AbstractReferenceCountedByteBuf` and `AbstractReferenceCounted`. The current implementation uses a compare-and-set (CAS) loop to atomically update the reference count. Under high contention, threads can spend significant time spinning in this loop, leading to increased CPU usage and latency.

To improve this, I will replace the CAS loop with a more direct atomic operation, `getAndAdd()`, provided by `AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater`. This operation is often implemented as a single hardware instruction (like `lock xadd` on x86), which can be more efficient than the `lock cmpxchg`-based loop, especially under contention.

The original implementation performed checks before attempting the CAS operation to prevent illegal state transitions (e.g., resurrecting a released object or over-releasing). With `getAndAdd()`, the update happens first, so the checks must be performed after the fact. If an illegal transition is detected, a second `getAndAdd()` is used to revert the change before throwing an `IllegalReferenceCountException`. This approach eliminates the spin loop, reducing CPU consumption under contention, at the cost of a second atomic operation on the rare invalid-usage code path.

These changes are applied to both `AbstractReferenceCountedByteBuf` and `AbstractReferenceCounted` classes, as they share the same reference counting logic.
