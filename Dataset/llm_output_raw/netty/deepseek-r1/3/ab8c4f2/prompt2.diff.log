## Explanation of Improvements

The performance issue states that the HPACK static table is organized so that fields with the same name are sequential. Currently, when scanning for a header field with a specific name and value, the code continues scanning even after encountering entries with different names. This is inefficient because once we encounter a different name, we know we won't find a match further in the table (since same-name entries are grouped together).

The improvement short-circuits the scan when a name mismatch occurs, reducing unnecessary comparisons and improving lookup performance in the static table.
