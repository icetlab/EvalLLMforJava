The performance issue relates to the HPACK static table lookup method `getIndexInsensitive`, which performs a linear scan through entries with the same name. Since the static table is organized with same-name entries sequentially, the scan can be short-circuited early when a name mismatch occurs, avoiding unnecessary comparisons.

The optimization changes the loop to first check if the current entry's name matches the target name. If not, it breaks out of the loop immediately because subsequent entries will have different names (due to the sequential ordering). This reduces the number of comparisons when the target value isn't found among same-name entries.
