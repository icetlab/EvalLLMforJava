My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the hot paths in the `Recycler` class.
First, I will refactor the `get()` method. The original implementation has a nested conditional structure. By restructuring it to handle the common case (retrieving a recycled object) with an early return, we can improve readability and potentially performance by making the hot path more direct.

Second, I will optimize the state transition in the `DefaultHandle`. The `toAvailable()` method, called during recycling, uses an `AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater` with `getAndSet` to detect double-recycling. I will replace this with `compareAndSet`, which is generally more efficient as it can avoid returning the previous value, leading to a reduction in overhead for this atomic operation.

These changes are designed to reduce allocation and recycling overhead, especially in high-throughput applications that make extensive use of the `Recycler`.
