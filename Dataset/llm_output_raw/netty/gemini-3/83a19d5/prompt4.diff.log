My proposed improvement is to replace the compare-and-set (CAS) loop for reference counting with a more efficient `getAndAdd` operation. The current implementation uses a `for (;;)` loop with `compareAndSet`, which can lead to high CPU usage under contention as threads spin-wait.

By using `AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater.getAndAdd()`, we can update the reference count with a single atomic operation in the common case. This is generally more efficient than a CAS loop, especially under high contention, as it often maps to a single hardware instruction like `lock xadd`.

The logic for `retain` and `release` is adapted to this new approach. After an optimistic `getAndAdd`, I perform a check. If the update is invalid (e.g., resurrection, overflow, or over-release), I revert the change with another `getAndAdd` and throw the appropriate exception. Since these invalid cases are exceptional, the performance of the common path is significantly improved. This change is applied to both `AbstractReferenceCounted` and `AbstractReferenceCountedByteBuf` to ensure consistent behavior and performance across reference-counted objects in Netty.
