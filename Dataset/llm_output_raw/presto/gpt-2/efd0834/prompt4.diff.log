The change below removes the eager memory accounting call from the constructor of ProjectSelectedPositions, deferring it until after the first batch is processed. This avoids unnecessary retained‚Äêsize computation at construction time.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../presto/presto-main/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/operator/project/PageProcessor.java",
    "search": "            this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];\n            updateRetainedSize();",
    "replace": "            this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];\n            // defer memory accounting until after first batch is processed"
  }
]
```
