The performance of key lookups in `SingleMapBlock` can be improved by simplifying the calculation of `hashTableOffset` and `hashTableSize` within the various `seekKey` methods.

The original code calculates these values using `offset / 2 * HASH_MULTIPLIER` and `positionCount / 2 * HASH_MULTIPLIER`. Given that `HASH_MULTIPLIER` is a constant with a value of `2`, and both `offset` and `positionCount` are guaranteed to be even numbers, these expressions can be simplified to just `offset` and `positionCount` respectively. This optimization removes two integer division and two multiplication operations from each key lookup, which can be significant in performance-critical code paths.

I will apply this simplification to all `seekKey` and `seekKeyExact` methods in `SingleMapBlock.java`. Since the code snippet to be replaced is identical across all these methods, a single replacement rule can be applied globally within the file.
