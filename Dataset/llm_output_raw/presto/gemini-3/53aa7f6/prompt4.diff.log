The performance issue is that `GeneratedPageProjection` does not reserve enough memory for `BlockBuilder` instances before projecting rows. The existing implementation creates `BlockBuilder`s with a small default capacity, which can lead to multiple re-allocations and data copies as rows are added, degrading performance.

My improvement addresses this by creating new `BlockBuilder` instances for each `project` call, sized appropriately for the number of rows to be processed. The number of rows is available from `selectedPositions.size()`. By pre-allocating the necessary memory, we can avoid the overhead of resizing the block builders during projection.

Specifically, I'm changing the `project` method to create a new list of `BlockBuilder`s using `projection.getType().createBlockBuilder(null, selectedPositions.size())`. This ensures that each `BlockBuilder` is initialized with an expected size that matches the number of selected positions, thus improving performance by reducing memory re-allocation overhead.
