The performance of `WindowOperator` can be improved by optimizing the `findEndPosition` method. This method is critical for locating group boundaries within partitions.

The original implementation uses a binary search across the entire partition to find the end of the current group. While effective, this can be suboptimal for data distributions with either very large or very small groups.

The improved implementation introduces two key optimizations:
1.  A fast-path check is added to handle the common case where the entire partition consists of a single group. This check compares the first and last elements of the range, and if they are the same, it immediately returns the end of the partition, avoiding any further searching.
2.  A galloping search (also known as exponential search) is used to efficiently narrow down the search space for the binary search. This is particularly effective for both very small and very large groups. It quickly finds a much smaller range where the group boundary must exist.

Finally, a binary search is performed on this reduced range, leading to fewer comparisons and better overall performance.
