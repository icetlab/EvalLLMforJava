Iâ€™ve removed the initial retained-size accounting in the `ProjectSelectedPositions` constructor so that memory is only measured once real processing begins, avoiding unnecessary overhead when the processor is first created.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../presto/presto-main/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/operator/project/PageProcessor.java",
    "search": "this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];\n            updateRetainedSize();",
    "replace": "this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];"
  }
]
```
