My proposed improvement focuses on optimizing the `getPartition` method in the `HashGenerator` interface. The key insight is that partition counts in distributed systems like Presto are often configured to be a power of two. In such cases, the modulo operation (`%`), which can be computationally expensive, can be replaced by a much faster bitwise AND operation (`&`).

My change introduces a check to determine if `partitionCount` is a power of two.
- If it is, it uses the bitwise AND `(rawHash & (partitionCount - 1))` to calculate the partition. This is a well-known, highly efficient technique that also correctly handles negative hash values, producing a non-negative partition index. This avoids the need to first make the hash positive.
- If `partitionCount` is not a power of two, the code falls back to the original, more general approach of clearing the sign bit of the hash and then applying the modulo operator.

This change ensures that for the common case of power-of-two partitions, performance is significantly improved, while correctness is maintained for all other cases. The check itself is extremely fast and has a negligible impact when the condition is false.
