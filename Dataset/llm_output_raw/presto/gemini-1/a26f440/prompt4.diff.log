The overall improvement is to optimize the `merge` operation for `TDigest`, especially when merging small digests. The original implementation forced a compression on the digest being merged, which is inefficient if it contains only a few points. The new implementation avoids this by directly accessing the merged and unmerged centroids of the other digest. Additionally, it corrects the handling of `min` and `max` values during a merge, which was flawed in the original implementation.
