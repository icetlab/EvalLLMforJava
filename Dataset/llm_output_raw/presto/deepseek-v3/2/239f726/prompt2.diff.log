Looking at the provided code and the performance issue "Optimize ST_Intersects geometry function", I can see that the current `stIntersects` function in `GeoFunctions.java` performs a full geometry intersection check without any early filtering. The main optimization opportunity is to add an envelope (bounding box) check before performing the more expensive geometry intersection operation. This is a common spatial optimization: if the bounding boxes don't intersect, the geometries cannot intersect.

Here's the plan:
1. Add an envelope check at the beginning of `stIntersects` to quickly return `false` when the bounding boxes don't intersect.
2. This avoids the expensive deserialization and intersection computation for obviously non-intersecting geometries.

The current `stIntersects` method:
```java
@SqlNullable
@Description("Returns TRUE if the Geometries spatially intersect in 2D - (share any portion of space) and FALSE if they don't (they are Disjoint)")
@ScalarFunction("ST_Intersects")
@SqlType(StandardTypes.BOOLEAN)
public static Boolean stIntersects(@SqlType(GEOMETRY_TYPE_NAME) Slice left, @SqlType(GEOMETRY_TYPE_NAME) Slice right)
{
    OGCGeometry leftGeometry = deserialize(left);
    OGCGeometry rightGeometry = deserialize(right);
    verifySameSpatialReference(leftGeometry, rightGeometry);
    return leftGeometry.intersects(rightGeometry);
}
```

We'll modify it to:
1. First check if either envelope is null (empty geometry) → return false
2. Check if envelopes intersect → if not, return false
3. Only then proceed with full geometry deserialization and intersection check

This follows the same pattern used in `stContains` which already has an envelope check.
