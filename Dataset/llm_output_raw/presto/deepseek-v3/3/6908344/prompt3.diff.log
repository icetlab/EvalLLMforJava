Looking at the build error, the issue is a Checkstyle violation in GeometrySerde.java at line 285: "RightCurly: '}' at column 9 should be alone on a line." This means there's a formatting issue with a closing brace not being on its own line. The error occurs in the `merge` method where I previously made changes that introduced an `else` statement without proper formatting.

Let me examine the current code and fix the formatting issue. The problem is that the `else` block should have its opening brace on the same line as `else`, and the closing brace should be on its own line.
