Iâ€™ve deferred the initial memory accounting by removing the `updateRetainedSize()` call from the `ProjectSelectedPositions` constructor. This ensures `memoryContext` remains at zero until after the first batch is processed.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../presto/presto-main/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/operator/project/PageProcessor.java",
    "search": "this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];\n            updateRetainedSize();",
    "replace": "this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];"
  }
]
```
