The primary performance improvement is to switch the implementation of the `ST_Buffer` function from using the ESRI Geometry API to the JTS (Java Topology Suite) library. The provided benchmark, `BenchmarkSTBuffer`, heavily tests this function with increasingly complex geometries. JTS is a widely-used, mature library for geospatial operations, and its `buffer` implementation is often more performant than alternatives.

This change involves replacing `EsriGeometrySerde` with `JtsGeometrySerde` for deserializing the input geometry and serializing the result. The core operation is changed from `OGCGeometry.buffer()` to `Geometry.buffer()`.

Additionally, a potential `NullPointerException` is fixed. The `deserialize` methods can return `null` for empty input geometries, which was not handled in the original code. A `null` check is added to make the function more robust, ensuring it correctly returns `null` for empty geometries as expected by the unit tests.
