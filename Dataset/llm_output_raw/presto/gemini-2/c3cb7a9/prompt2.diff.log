My analysis suggests that the `findEndPosition` method, which uses a binary search to locate the end of a group, can be improved. The existing implementation, while functionally correct, uses a slightly unconventional binary search structure.

I will replace it with a more standard and widely recognized binary search algorithm for finding an "upper bound". This updated implementation is not only cleaner and easier to understand but also employs a safer method for calculating the midpoint, which prevents potential integer overflows. While the asymptotic complexity remains O(log N), this change can lead to minor performance improvements due to a more efficient loop structure and better compiler optimization, in addition to enhancing code clarity and robustness.
