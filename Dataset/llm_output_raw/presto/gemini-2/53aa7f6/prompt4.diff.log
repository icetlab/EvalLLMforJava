My improvement strategy is to pre-allocate memory for the `BlockBuilder` instances used in page projection. The current implementation initializes `BlockBuilder`s with a minimal capacity, which can lead to multiple resizes and re-allocations when processing pages with many rows, degrading performance.

By using `selectedPositions.size()`, I can determine the exact number of rows that will be projected. I will use this information to create new `BlockBuilder`s with the appropriate capacity before the projection work begins. This avoids dynamic resizing of the block builders' underlying buffers, leading to more efficient memory usage and faster execution.

This change is isolated to the `project` method within `GeneratedPageProjection` and preserves the existing logic of creating fresh `BlockBuilder`s for each projection task, ensuring that failed executions do not corrupt subsequent ones.

    "replace": "blockBuilders = projections.stream().map(projection -> projection.getType().createBlockBuilder(null, selectedPositions.size())).collect(toImmutableList());"
  }
]
