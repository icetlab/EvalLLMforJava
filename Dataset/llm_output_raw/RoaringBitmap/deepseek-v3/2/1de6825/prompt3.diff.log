Looking at the build error, the issue is that `getByteFromLong` is being called in `Node16.java` but the method doesn't exist in the class. The error shows that in `Node16.java:44` and other locations, there are calls to `getByteFromLong(value, mid)` but this method isn't defined in the `Node16` class.

The problem is that in the previous changes, I added `getByteFromLong` as a private static method to `Node16`, but there are other references to `getByteFromLong` in the code that weren't part of the changes I made. Looking at the error lines:

1. Line 44: `byte midVal = getByteFromLong(value, mid);` - This is in `Node16.java` but not in the code snippet provided
2. Lines 103, 105, 213 also reference `getByteFromLong`

This suggests that the original `Node16.java` file already had calls to `getByteFromLong` but the method wasn't defined. The provided source code snippet doesn't show these lines, which means the actual file on disk has different content than what was provided.

Since I can't see the full current content of `Node16.java`, I need to work with what I know. The build is failing because `getByteFromLong` is not defined. I need to add this method to the `Node16` class.

Let me add the `getByteFromLong` method to fix the compilation error:

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/src/main/java/org/roaringbitmap/art/Node16.java",
    "search": "public class Node16 extends Node {\n\n  long firstV = 0L;\n  long secondV = 0L;\n  Node[] children = new Node[16];",
    "replace": "public class Node16 extends Node {\n\n  long firstV = 0L;\n  long secondV = 0L;\n  Node[] children = new Node[16];\n\n  private static byte getByteFromLong(long value, int pos) {\n    // pos in [0,7], 0 is most significant byte (big-endian)\n    return (byte) (value >>> ((7 - pos) << 3));\n  }"
  }
]
```

This should fix the compilation error by adding the missing `getByteFromLong` method that's being called in the existing code.
