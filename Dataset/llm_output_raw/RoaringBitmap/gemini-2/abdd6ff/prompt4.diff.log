My improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the `topK` method in `BitSliceIndexBase.java`. The existing implementation has a section marked with `// TODO: make faster` responsible for trimming excess results when ties occur. This section currently iterates through the result set and builds a new bitmap of elements to remove one by one, which is inefficient for large numbers of removals.

The provided benchmark, `SelectTopValuesBenchmark`, suggests that using `MutableRoaringBitmap.limit(n)` is a significantly more performant way to select the first `n` elements. My change replaces the manual iteration with a single call to `F.limit((int) n)` to create the bitmap of elements to be removed. This bitmap is then used with `andNot` to efficiently remove the excess elements from the result set `F`. This approach leverages the highly optimized internal implementation of `limit` and `andNot` in the RoaringBitmap library, leading to a substantial performance improvement, especially when many elements need to be removed.
