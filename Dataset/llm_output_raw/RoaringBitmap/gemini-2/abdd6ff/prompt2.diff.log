The performance issue is the slow removal of top values in the `topK` method, specifically the part responsible for trimming the result set `F` to the exact size `k`. The original implementation iterates through the `F` bitmap, builds a new `turnoff` bitmap containing the first `n` elements to be removed, and then performs a bitmap `andNot` operation. This is inefficient due to the creation of a potentially large intermediate bitmap and the per-element iteration.

My improvement replaces this logic with a much more efficient approach that leverages the high-performance `select` and `remove` methods of `RoaringBitmap`.
1.  It calculates `n`, the number of elements to remove.
2.  If `n` is greater than or equal to the total cardinality, it simply clears the bitmap, which is the correct behavior for `k <= 0`.
3.  Otherwise, it uses `F.select((int) (n - 1))` to quickly find the `n`-th smallest element. This element serves as the upper limit for removal.
4.  Finally, it calls `F.remove((long) F.first(), (long) limit + 1)`, which efficiently removes the range of smallest elements from the bitmap in a single operation.

This change avoids creating an intermediate bitmap and replaces a slow iteration with highly optimized internal methods of `RoaringBitmap`, resulting in a significant performance improvement for the `topK` operation. This new implementation correctly handles edge cases like `k=0` and preserves the original functionality while being substantially faster.
