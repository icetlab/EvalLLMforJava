## Fixing Checkstyle Violation

The build failed due to a checkstyle violation in Node16.java at line 88:63. The error indicates that the `&&` operator should be on a new line when breaking a condition across multiple lines, according to the OperatorWrap rule. This is a formatting issue that needs to be fixed while preserving all functionality.

The specific issue is in the `getNearestChildPos` method where the condition spans multiple lines. According to checkstyle rules, when breaking a condition across multiple lines, the operator should start the new line rather than end the previous line.
