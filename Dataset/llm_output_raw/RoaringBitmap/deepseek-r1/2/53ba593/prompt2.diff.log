Based on the performance issue description, I need to avoid computing cardinality for run containers when not needed. The main issue is in the `contains` method of `RoaringBitmap.java` that calls `getCardinality()` on containers to check if they're full, which is inefficient for run containers.

The key improvement is to replace the `getCardinality() != 1 << 16` check with the `isFull()` method which is already available on containers and more efficient for run containers.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/src/main/java/org/roaringbitmap/RoaringBitmap.java",
    "search": "    for (int i = begin + 1; i < end; ++i) {\n      if (highLowContainer.getContainerAtIndex(i).getCardinality() != 1 << 16) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }",
    "replace": "    for (int i = begin + 1; i < end; ++i) {\n      if (!highLowContainer.getContainerAtIndex(i).isFull()) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }"
  }
]
```
