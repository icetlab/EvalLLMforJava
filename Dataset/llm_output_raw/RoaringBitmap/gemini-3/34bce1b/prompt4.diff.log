My goal is to improve the performance of the `shiftLeftFromSpecifiedPosition` method by replacing the byte array conversion and `System.arraycopy` with direct bitwise manipulation. This avoids object allocation and is significantly faster.

The previous attempt failed due to a subtle bug in the bitmask generation logic for an edge case where a shift amount of 32 was used. This resulted in an incorrect mask and a wrong result.

This new version corrects the mask generation logic. It now correctly handles all shift amounts, including the edge case that caused the test failure. The core optimization strategy of using bitwise operations remains the same:
1.  Calculate masks to isolate the parts of the integer that will be preserved and the parts that will be shifted.
2.  Clear the destination area in the integer.
3.  Isolate the source bytes.
4.  Shift the source bytes to their new position.
5.  Combine the preserved parts and the shifted parts to get the final result.

This corrected implementation is both functionally correct, passing all unit tests, and significantly more performant than the original version.
