The performance issue stems from unnecessary object and collection creation during ACL matching. The `AclSets` helper class eagerly evaluates collections, and its `find` method is inefficient as it doesn't short-circuit after finding a match. Additionally, the `matchingAcls` method creates a new `Set` for prefixed ACLs on every authorization check, which is a performance bottleneck.

My improvement addresses these issues by:
1.  Modifying the `AclSets` class to operate on more generic `Iterable`s instead of `Set`s and to use lazy evaluation (`view`) for its `find` operation. This makes `find` more efficient by stopping at the first match.
2.  Updating the `matchingAcls` method to avoid creating a new `Set` for prefixed ACLs. Instead, it now passes the `Iterable` of ACLs directly to the `AclSets` constructor.

These changes reduce object allocation and unnecessary computation in the critical authorization path, leading to better performance.
