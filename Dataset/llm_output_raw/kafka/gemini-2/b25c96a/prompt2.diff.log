The current implementation for expiring producer IDs iterates through all producers, collects the expired ones into a list, and then removes them from the main map. This is inefficient as it requires a full scan and an intermediate collection.

My improvement refactors this process to use `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This allows for the removal of expired entries in a single pass over the map without allocating an intermediate list of keys to be removed, leading to better performance and reduced memory pressure.

Specifically:
1.  The `removeExpiredProducers` method is updated to use `removeIf` for both the `producers` map and the `verificationStates` map, which is a more direct and efficient way to remove elements based on a predicate.
2.  The private helper method `removeProducerIds`, which was only used in the old implementation of `removeExpiredProducers`, has been removed as it is no longer needed.

These changes preserve the original functionality while making the expiration logic more performant.
