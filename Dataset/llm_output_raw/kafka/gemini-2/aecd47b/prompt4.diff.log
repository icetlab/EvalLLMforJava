The previous attempt failed due to a compilation error. The code tried to use the `Checksum.update(ByteBuffer)` method, which was introduced in Java 9, but the project is compiled with Java 8, where this method doesn't exist on the `Checksum` interface.

To fix this, I will use reflection to dynamically detect and invoke the `update(ByteBuffer)` method at runtime. This approach ensures that the code remains compatible with Java 8 while leveraging the performance benefits of the new method when running on Java 9 or later.

My changes are as follows:
1.  I will add a static initializer block to the `Checksums` class. This block will attempt to get a `Method` handle for `Checksum.update(ByteBuffer)`. This will only succeed on Java 9+, and the handle will be stored in a static final field. On Java 8, this field will remain `null`. This check is performed only once when the class is loaded, minimizing performance overhead.
2.  In the `update(Checksum, ByteBuffer, int, int)` method, for non-array-backed buffers, I will first check if the `Method` handle is available.
    -   If it is, I will use reflection to invoke the optimized `update(ByteBuffer)` method. This logic is wrapped in a `try-finally` block to ensure the buffer's original position and limit are restored, preserving the method's contract. If the reflective call succeeds, the method returns. If it fails for any reason, it will fall through to the original byte-by-byte implementation.
    -   If the `Method` handle is not available (i.e., running on Java 8), the code will execute the original, safe byte-by-byte update logic.

This solution resolves the compilation error and correctly implements the intended performance optimization in a backward-compatible way.
