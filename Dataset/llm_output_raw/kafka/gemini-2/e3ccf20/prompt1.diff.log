My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the hot path of the `AclAuthorizer`, specifically the `authorize` method and its helpers. The key changes are:

1.  **Optimize `allowAclExists` check:** The original implementation involved a nested iteration, first over a set of applicable operations and then over the set of ACLs for each operation. This has been refactored to a single iteration over the ACLs, which significantly reduces complexity from `O(M*N)` to `O(N)` (where M is the number of applicable operations and N is the number of ACLs), providing a substantial performance boost, especially when dealing with operations that imply others (like `DESCRIBE`).

2.  **Improve Prefixed ACL Matching:** The logic for finding matching prefixed ACLs in `matchingAcls` was creating intermediate collections. This has been optimized to use an iterator-based approach (`.iterator.filter.flatMap.toSet`), which avoids the allocation of these intermediate collections, reducing memory pressure and improving performance on this critical path.

These changes preserve the original functionality, including logging behavior (with a minor, acceptable simplification for determinism), and are validated by the existing unit tests.
