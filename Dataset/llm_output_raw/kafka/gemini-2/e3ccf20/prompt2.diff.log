The core performance issue lies in the `matchingAcls` method, which eagerly constructs a large, merged `Set` of ACLs using the `++` operator. This operation is inefficient, especially with many ACLs, as it involves repeated hashing and the creation of intermediate collections. The merged set is then iterated over for authorization checks.

My improvement strategy is to avoid this eager set construction altogether. I will refactor the logic to work with an `Iterable` of ACL sets (`Iterable[Set[AclEntry]]`) instead of a single merged set. This has two main benefits:
1.  It eliminates the costly `++` operations on large sets. The `prefixed`, `wildcard`, and `literal` ACL sets are collected into a lightweight `Iterable` without being merged.
2.  It enables short-circuiting during authorization checks. When searching for `DENY` or `ALLOW` rules, the code can now stop as soon as a matching rule is found in any of the ACL sets, without having to process the remaining sets. This is more efficient than iterating over a single large, merged set.

To achieve this, I will make two related changes:
1.  Modify the `matchingAcls` method to return an `Iterable[Set[AclEntry]]` instead of a single `Set[AclEntry]`, and update its implementation to avoid merging the ACL sets.
2.  Update the `aclsAllowAccess` helper method within `authorizeAction` to process this `Iterable` of sets, applying the authorization logic sequentially and leveraging short-circuiting.

These changes are applied together to ensure correctness and deliver a significant performance improvement to the `authorize` path.
