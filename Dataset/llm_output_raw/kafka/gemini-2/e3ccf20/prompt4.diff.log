The core performance issue is the repeated merging of large ACL sets using Scala's `++` operator within the `authorize` method's hot path. This operation is inefficient, especially when dealing with a large number of ACLs, as it involves iterating and rebuilding sets, leading to significant overhead from hashing and object creation.

My improvement strategy is to eliminate this set-merging step entirely. Instead of creating a single large set of all applicable ACLs (literal, prefixed, and wildcard), I will modify the authorization logic to check each type of ACL set individually.

The new logic will:
1.  Fetch the literal, prefixed, and wildcard ACL sets separately without merging them.
2.  Check for `DENY` rules sequentially across these sets (starting with the most specific: literal, then prefixed, then wildcard). The check will short-circuit and deny access as soon as the first matching `DENY` rule is found.
3.  If no `DENY` rules are found, it will proceed to check for `ALLOW` rules in the same order, short-circuiting and granting access upon finding the first match.

This approach avoids the costly `++` operation and benefits from early termination during ACL evaluation, significantly improving the performance of the `authorize` method, which is critical as it's executed for every request.
