The performance issue is that `Partition.makeFollower()` can be blocked by ongoing log appends on a follower replica. This is because `makeFollower()` acquires a write lock on `leaderIsrUpdateLock`, while `doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()` (which handles follower appends) acquires a read lock on the same lock.

To resolve this, I will introduce a new `ReentrantReadWriteLock` called `futureLogLock`. This new lock will be used to synchronize log append operations with operations that modify the log structure, such as swapping the current log with a future log during replica directory migration.

Here are the details of the changes:
1.  A new `futureLogLock` is added to the `Partition` class.
2.  `doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()` will now acquire a read lock on `futureLogLock` instead of `leaderIsrUpdateLock`. This decouples follower appends from leader/follower state changes, preventing `makeFollower()` from being blocked.
3.  The methods `removeFutureLocalReplica()` and `maybeReplaceCurrentWithFutureReplica()`, which alter the future log or swap it with the current log, will now acquire a write lock on `futureLogLock` to safely coordinate with append operations. They will also continue to hold `leaderIsrUpdateLock` for modifications to the partition's state variables (`log`, `futureLog`), ensuring thread safety. The lock acquisition order is carefully managed to prevent deadlocks.

These changes will improve concurrency by allowing follower appends to proceed without blocking partition state changes like `makeFollower()`, which should reduce ISR shrinks during controlled shutdowns.
