The primary performance issue is in the `makeFollower` method of the `Partition` class. The original implementation holds a write lock for the entire duration of the method, even when no state change is necessary. It performs all state updates and then checks if the state was already correct, returning `false` in that case. This is inefficient as it performs unnecessary work and holds a contended lock for longer than required, especially when called repeatedly with the same state, as in the provided benchmark.

My improvement refactors the `makeFollower` method to perform an early check for whether the partition is already in the desired follower state. If so, it returns `false` immediately without acquiring the write lock for an extended period or performing redundant state updates. This significantly reduces lock contention and CPU usage in scenarios where `makeFollower` is called on a partition that is already a follower with the correct leader and epoch. Additionally, I've optimized a collection conversion to be more efficient and consistent with other parts of the codebase.
