Iâ€™ve replaced the remaining `trace` calls in `updateResourceAcls` with `authorizerLogger.trace` so that logging works after removing the `Logging` trait.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../kafka/core/src/main/scala/kafka/security/authorizer/AclAuthorizer.scala",
    "search": "trace(s\"Deleting path for $resource because it had no ACLs remaining\")",
    "replace": "authorizerLogger.trace(s\"Deleting path for $resource because it had no ACLs remaining\")"
  },
  {
    "filepath": "../kafka/core/src/main/scala/kafka/security/authorizer/AclAuthorizer.scala",
    "search": "trace(s\"Failed to update ACLs for $resource. Used version ${currentVersionedAcls.zkVersion}. Reading data and retrying update.\")",
    "replace": "authorizerLogger.trace(s\"Failed to update ACLs for $resource. Used version ${currentVersionedAcls.zkVersion}. Reading data and retrying update.\")"
  }
]
```
