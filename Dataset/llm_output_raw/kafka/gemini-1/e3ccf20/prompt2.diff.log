The performance of ACL checking is improved by optimizing the `authorize` method, which is a critical path for requests. The original code merged several sets of ACLs using the `++` operator, which can be slow due to the hashing of all elements, particularly when dealing with a large number of ACLs.

My change avoids the creation of this merged `Set`. Instead, it creates a lazy `Iterable` that provides a unified view over the various ACL collections (prefixed, wildcard, and literal). This defers the cost of processing elements until they are actually needed during iteration and avoids the expensive upfront creation of a large `Set`. This is accomplished by changing the return type of the `matchingAcls` method to `Iterable[AclEntry]` and adjusting the consuming methods to work with an `Iterable` instead of a `Set`.
