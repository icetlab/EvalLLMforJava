My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the hot path of authorization checks in `AclAuthorizer`. The key changes include:

1.  **Optimizing `allowAclExists`**: The original implementation created `Set` objects on every call within the `authorizeAction` method, which is a performance-sensitive path. I've replaced this with a series of direct checks that avoid collection allocation, improving both speed and reducing garbage collection pressure.
2.  **Improving `AclSets.find`**: The `find` method was implemented using a strict `flatMap` on a sequence of sets, causing it to iterate through all sets even if a match was found early. I've changed this to use a `view`, which makes the operation lazy and allows it to short-circuit, stopping as soon as a match is found.
3.  **Reducing memory allocation in `deleteAcls`**: The `deleteAcls` method, while not on the authorization hot path, holds a lock during its execution. The original code could create large intermediate collections when calculating which resources to update. I've introduced the use of `view` to process the collections lazily and combined them into a `Set` at the end, reducing peak memory usage and making the operation more efficient.

These changes collectively enhance the performance and efficiency of the `AclAuthorizer`, particularly under heavy load.
