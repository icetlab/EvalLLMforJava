The primary performance issue is in the `makeFollower` method of the `Partition` class. The provided benchmark, `PartitionMakeFollowerBenchmark`, highlights a scenario where `makeFollower` is called repeatedly, potentially with no actual state change, while another thread is concurrently appending records.

The original `makeFollower` implementation acquires a write lock for the entire duration of the method. It performs state updates, including potentially slow collection conversions, even when there is no change in the leader or epoch. This leads to unnecessary contention on the `leaderIsrUpdateLock`, blocking other operations like `appendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica` which require a read lock.

My improvement refactors the `makeFollower` method to perform an early exit. It now checks if the leader and epoch have changed at the beginning of the method, inside the write lock. If there's no change, it returns immediately, significantly reducing the lock hold time in the common no-op case. This directly addresses the contention scenario tested by the benchmark.

Additionally, I've optimized the collection conversion for the replica assignment list to be more efficient and consistent with the `makeLeader` method, changing `... .asScala.iterator.map(_.toInt).toSeq` to the more direct `... .asScala.map(_.toInt)`.

These changes will improve performance by reducing lock contention and streamlining the execution path for no-op follower updates, while preserving the correctness of state transitions.
