My proposed improvement focuses on optimizing the `sizeOfUnsignedVarint` and `sizeOfVarlong` methods in `ByteUtils.java`. The original implementations use iterative `while` loops to determine the number of bytes required for variable-length encoding. These loops can be inefficient due to their iterative nature and branching.

To enhance performance, I will replace these loops with a more efficient, branchless mathematical approach that leverages Java's built-in `numberOfLeadingZeros` methods. This method is often compiled down to a single, fast CPU instruction (an intrinsic). The new logic calculates the size by determining the number of 7-bit groups required to represent the value, which is functionally equivalent to the original loop but significantly faster. This change will improve the performance of producers, especially in scenarios involving high throughput, by speeding up the record size estimation in `tryAppend()`.
