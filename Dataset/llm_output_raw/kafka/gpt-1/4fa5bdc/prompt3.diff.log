Iâ€™ve added guards around debug log calls to avoid expensive string interpolation when debug logging is disabled, reducing overhead in the hot authorization path.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../kafka/core/src/main/scala/kafka/security/authorizer/AclAuthorizer.scala",
    "search": "authorizerLogger.debug(s\"No acl found for resource $resource, authorized = $shouldAllowEveryoneIfNoAclIsFound\")",
    "replace": "if (authorizerLogger.underlying.isDebugEnabled)\n  authorizerLogger.debug(s\"No acl found for resource $resource, authorized = $shouldAllowEveryoneIfNoAclIsFound\")"
  },
  {
    "filepath": "../kafka/core/src/main/scala/kafka/security/authorizer/AclAuthorizer.scala",
    "search": "authorizerLogger.debug(s\"operation = $operation on resource = $resource from host = $host is $permissionType based on acl = $acl\")",
    "replace": "if (authorizerLogger.underlying.isDebugEnabled)\n  authorizerLogger.debug(s\"operation = $operation on resource = $resource from host = $host is $permissionType based on acl = $acl\")"
  }
]
```
