## Explanation

The performance issue is in the `removeExpiredProducers` method, which currently uses a stream to filter all producers and collect expired keys into a list, then removes them all at once. This is inefficient because:
1. It iterates through all producers even if none are expired
2. It creates intermediate collections (lists) for expired keys
3. The removal uses `removeAll` which internally iterates through the keys list

The fix is to use an iterator to traverse the map and remove expired entries directly, avoiding intermediate collections and unnecessary iterations.
