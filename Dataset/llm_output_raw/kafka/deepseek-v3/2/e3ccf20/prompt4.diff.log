## Explanation

The performance issue is in the `matchingAcls` method where we combine multiple ACL sets using `++` operations. Specifically, the line `prefixed ++ wildcard ++ literal` performs two Set concatenations which can be expensive when the sets are large (especially the wildcard set which can have many entries). The problem is that Scala's `++` operation on immutable sets creates new sets by iterating through all elements and computing hash codes, which becomes costly with large sets.

We need to optimize this by avoiding unnecessary set concatenations. Since we're only checking for existence of matching ACLs (via `matchingAclExists`), we don't actually need to create a merged set. Instead, we can check each set individually and return early when we find a match.

However, looking at the code flow:
1. `matchingAcls` returns a `Set[AclEntry]`
2. This set is used in `isEmptyAclAndAuthorized`, `denyAclExists`, and `allowAclExists`
3. `denyAclExists` and `allowAclExists` both call `matchingAclExists` which iterates through the entire set

The key insight is that we can optimize by:
1. Avoiding the creation of the merged set when checking for denies (since any deny should block access)
2. Checking denies first before checking allows
3. Using a more efficient approach to combine sets when needed

But actually, looking more carefully at the logic in `authorizeAction`:
- First checks if ACLs are empty
- Then checks for deny ACLs
- Then checks for allow ACLs

We can optimize by:
1. Checking denies on each set individually without merging
2. Only merging for allow checks if no denies were found

However, the simplest and most effective optimization is to use `Set.concat` (Scala 2.13+) or create the union more efficiently. Since we're working with Scala 2.12 in Kafka, we can use `Set.empty ++ prefixed ++ wildcard ++ literal` which is still `++` operations.

Actually, looking at the benchmark, the main issue is with large wildcard sets. Let's optimize by:
1. Checking denies first on each individual set to potentially fail fast
2. Using a view or iterator to avoid creating intermediate sets

But the cleanest solution is to use `foldLeft` or `union` operations more efficiently. Let me implement a more efficient union operation.

Wait, I realize the third change doesn't actually modify anything. Let me reconsider. The real issue is in `matchingAcls` where we do `prefixed ++ wildcard ++ literal`. Let me provide a better optimization that avoids creating the full union when we're just checking for existence:

Actually, looking at the code again, we need the full set for both deny and allow checks. But we can optimize by checking denies on individual sets first to potentially fail fast. However, that would require restructuring the logic significantly.

Instead, let me provide a more targeted optimization that improves the union operation:

  }
]
```

Actually, let me check if there's a better approach. The issue description says the problem is with `++` being slow when the right-hand set has many entries. Let me optimize by using a more efficient approach:
