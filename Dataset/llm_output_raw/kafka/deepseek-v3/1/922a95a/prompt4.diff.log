## Explanation

The performance issue is that `Partition.makeFollower()` holds a write lock on `leaderIsrUpdateLock`, while `Partition.doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()` holds a read lock on the same lock. This causes contention: if there's an ongoing log append on a follower, the `makeFollower()` call will be delayed. This is problematic during controlled shutdown when a follower becomes leader and another follower needs to follow the new leader - the `makeFollower()` delay can cause ISR to shrink.

The root cause is that `doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()` needs the read lock only to coordinate with `maybeReplaceCurrentWithFutureReplica()` during log directory replacement. We can solve this by introducing a separate lock (`futureLogLock`) that synchronizes between these two methods, allowing `doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()` to avoid holding the `leaderIsrUpdateLock` read lock.

## Changes

We'll:
1. Add a new `futureLogLock` field
2. Use it in `doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()` and `maybeReplaceCurrentWithFutureReplica()`
3. Remove the `leaderIsrUpdateLock` read lock from `doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()`
4. Update related methods that need synchronization with future log operations
