My analysis of the `ProducerStateManager.java` file, particularly the `removeExpiredProducers` method, reveals a performance bottleneck. The current implementation iterates through producer and verification state maps, collects keys of expired entries into separate lists, and then iterates over these lists to remove the entries. This approach is inefficient for a large number of producers, as it involves creating large intermediate lists and performing multiple traversals of the data.

To improve performance, I will refactor `removeExpiredProducers` to use `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This method allows for in-place removal of entries that match a given predicate, avoiding the creation of intermediate collections and reducing the number of iterations to a single pass over each map. This change will significantly reduce memory allocation and processing time, especially when dealing with a large number of producer states, as is the case in the provided benchmark.
