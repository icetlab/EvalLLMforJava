The performance issue is that `Partition.makeFollower()` can be blocked by ongoing log appends on a follower replica, because both operations acquire locks on the same `leaderIsrUpdateLock`. This can delay follower synchronization and cause unnecessary ISR shrinking, especially during controlled shutdowns.

To address this, I will introduce a new `ReentrantReadWriteLock` named `futureLogLock`. This lock will specifically manage concurrent access to a follower's log during replica alterations, decoupling it from general ISR and leader state management.

Here are the detailed changes:
1.  A new `futureLogLock` is added to the `Partition` class.
2.  `doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()` is modified. When appending to a follower's log (`isFuture = false`), it will now acquire a read lock on the new `futureLogLock` instead of `leaderIsrUpdateLock`. This prevents `makeFollower()` from being blocked by follower log appends. Appends to a future log will continue to use `leaderIsrUpdateLock` for synchronization with other future log operations.
3.  `maybeReplaceCurrentWithFutureReplica()` is updated to acquire a write lock on `futureLogLock` in addition to `leaderIsrUpdateLock`. This ensures that it can safely inspect and replace the current log without interference from concurrent follower appends.

These changes will reduce lock contention on `leaderIsrUpdateLock`, improving the performance of `makeFollower()` and making the system more resilient during leadership changes.
