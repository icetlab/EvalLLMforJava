My improvement strategy focuses on optimizing ACL matching by avoiding unnecessary object allocations, specifically the creation of intermediate `Set` collections.

First, I will modify the `AclSets` helper class. Its constructor will be updated to accept `Iterable[AclEntry]` instead of `Set[AclEntry]`. This change allows us to pass lazy collections of ACLs without eagerly evaluating them into a `Set`. Additionally, the `find` method within `AclSets` will be improved to use a `view`. This ensures that searching for a matching ACL is done lazily, preventing the creation of an intermediate collection of all matching entries and stopping as soon as the first match is found.

Second, I will update the `matchingAcls` method, which gathers ACLs for a given resource. I will remove the `.toSet` conversion when collecting prefixed ACLs. This change avoids the expensive creation of a new `Set` for every authorization check, instead creating a lightweight `Iterable`. This directly leverages the modification to `AclSets` and significantly reduces allocations in a performance-critical path.

These two changes work together to reduce memory pressure and CPU cycles during authorization by processing ACLs more efficiently.
