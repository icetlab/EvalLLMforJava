The primary performance bottleneck in the provided code is within the `removeExpiredProducers` method. This method currently uses streams to filter and collect keys of expired producers into a `List`, which is then used to remove entries from the `producers` and `verificationStates` maps. This approach is inefficient for large numbers of producers due to the overhead of creating intermediate lists and iterating over them again for removal.

To improve performance, I will refactor `removeExpiredProducers` to use `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This allows for in-place removal of entries that match the expiration predicate, avoiding the creation of temporary collections and multiple iterations. This change is more memory-efficient and significantly faster, especially when dealing with a large number of producers as highlighted by the benchmark.

Additionally, this refactoring makes the helper method `removeProducerIds` redundant. I will remove this now-unused private method to clean up the codebase. These changes will improve performance while preserving the original functionality and correctness.
