The current implementation for expiring producer IDs is inefficient. It iterates through all producer IDs, collects the expired ones into a new list, and then iterates through this new list to remove them from the main map. This process is memory-intensive and slow, especially with a large number of producers.

My improvement refactors the `removeExpiredProducers` method to use `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This allows for in-place removal of expired entries in a single iteration over the map, avoiding the creation of intermediate collections and significantly improving performance. As a result of this change, the now-unused private helper method `removeProducerIds` is also removed for code cleanliness.
