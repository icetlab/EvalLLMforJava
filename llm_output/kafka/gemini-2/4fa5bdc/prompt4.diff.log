My proposed improvement focuses on optimizing ACL matching in the `AclAuthorizer`. The key issue is the unnecessary creation of intermediate `Set` collections, particularly for prefixed ACLs, which can be numerous and lead to performance degradation.

My changes address this by:
1.  Modifying the `AclSets` helper class to operate on more generic and efficient `Iterable` collections instead of `Set`. This also includes making its `find` method lazy by using a `view`, which prevents the creation of intermediate collections and stops searching as soon as a match is found.
2.  Updating the `matchingAcls` method to no longer create a new `Set` for prefixed ACLs. Instead, it will pass a lazy `Iterable` of ACLs directly to the `AclSets` constructor.

These changes collectively reduce memory allocation and CPU cycles by avoiding the creation of large, temporary collections during the authorization process, directly addressing the identified performance bottleneck.

    "replace": "  class AclSets(sets: Iterable[AclEntry]*) {\n    def find(p: AclEntry => Boolean): Option[AclEntry] = sets.view.flatMap(_.find(p)).headOption\n    def isEmpty: Boolean = !sets.exists(_.nonEmpty)\n  }"

    "replace": "      .values\n      .flatMap { _.acls }"
