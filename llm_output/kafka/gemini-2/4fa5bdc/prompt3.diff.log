I have fixed the build error from the previous attempt. The error was caused by using `.headOption` on an `Iterator`, which is not available in Scala 2.12. I've corrected this by using `.view` to create a lazy sequence, which allows for a lazy `headOption` call. This preserves the intended performance improvement of making the `find` operation lazy.

The other performance enhancements from the previous attempt are retained:
1.  **Prefixed ACL Lookup:** The inefficient range scan for prefixed ACLs in `matchingAcls` is replaced with a series of direct lookups for each possible prefix, which is significantly faster.
2.  **ACL Evaluation Order:** The order of ACL set evaluation is changed to `literal, prefixed, wildcard` to check more specific rules first.
3.  **Short-circuiting:** The boolean logic in `aclsAllowAccess` is reordered to check for `allow` ACLs before `deny` ACLs, which can be more efficient.
4.  **`acls` Method Optimization:** The `acls` method is improved to avoid creating `AclBinding` objects unnecessarily by checking resource and entry filters separately.
