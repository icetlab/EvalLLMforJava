The performance issue stems from the `matchingAcls` method, which eagerly constructs a list of prefixed ACLs. In scenarios with a large number of topics and prefix-based ACLs, this can be inefficient. The `TreeMap.from/to` optimization is not always effective, leading to a large intermediate collection that is then filtered. This causes a performance regression.

My overall improvement strategy is two-fold:
1.  In `matchingAcls`, I will change the construction of the `prefixed` ACLs collection to be lazy. Instead of materializing all matching prefixed ACLs into a `Buffer`, I will create a `LazyList`. This avoids eagerly iterating over a potentially large portion of the ACL cache and building a large intermediate collection, deferring the work until the ACLs are actually accessed.
2.  In the `AclSeqs.find` method, I will introduce laziness to prevent searching through all ACL collections (`prefixed`, `wildcard`, `literal`) if a match is found early. By using a `.view`, the search will stop as soon as the first matching ACL is found in any of the collections, improving efficiency, especially when a matching DENY rule is found in a more specific ACL collection.

These changes ensure that we only perform the necessary work to authorize a request, significantly improving performance in cases with many ACLs.
