My previous change to optimize prefixed ACL matching was incorrect, causing the `testAuthorizeWithPrefixedResource` test to fail. The `takeWhile` condition was flawed because it didn't account for the fact that prefixes of a resource name are not necessarily contiguous in the reverse lexicographical ordering used by the `aclCache`'s `TreeMap`.

I am correcting this by replacing the faulty logic for finding prefixed ACLs. The new implementation correctly and robustly finds all matching prefixed ACLs. It works by:
1.  Starting an iteration from the resource's position in the `TreeMap`.
2.  Using `takeWhile` to limit the scan to only relevant resources (same resource type and `PREFIXED` pattern type). This correctly bounds the search space.
3.  Applying a `filter` to this bounded view to identify all keys that are true prefixes of the resource name.

This approach is not only correct but also fixes a latent bug in the original code that failed to find single-character prefixes. While the other changes for caching `Set` instances were correct, this fix is critical for functionality.
