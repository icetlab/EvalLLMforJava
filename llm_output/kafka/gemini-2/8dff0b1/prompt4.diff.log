The `acls()` method in `AclAuthorizer` iterates over all cached ACLs. For each resource, it maps its ACL entries to `AclBinding` objects and then filters them. This process creates an intermediate `Set` for each resource, which is inefficient and can lead to performance degradation from excessive object allocation and garbage collection, particularly when many resources are cached.

To optimize this, I will add `.view` to the ACLs set before the `map` and `filter` operations. This creates a lazy `View` of the set, causing `map` and `filter` to be executed without creating intermediate collections. The final list of `AclBinding` objects is constructed directly by `flatMap`, which significantly reduces memory allocations and improves performance.
