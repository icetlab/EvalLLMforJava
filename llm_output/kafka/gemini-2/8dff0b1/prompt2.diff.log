My proposed improvement for `AclAuthorizer.scala` focuses on optimizing the `acls` method. The original implementation was inefficient because it eagerly created intermediate `Set` collections and `AclBinding` objects for every ACL in the cache, even for those that would be filtered out later. This led to unnecessary object allocations and garbage collection overhead, especially with a large number of ACLs.

My change refactors the `acls` method to use a `for` comprehension over iterators. This approach has several performance benefits:
1.  **Lazy Evaluation**: By operating on iterators, the filtering and mapping are performed lazily. No intermediate collections are created.
2.  **Reduced Object Creation**: `AclBinding` objects are now created only for ACLs that match the filter criteria, significantly reducing object churn.
3.  **Early Filtering**: The logic now filters by `ResourcePattern` first, and only then by `AccessControlEntry`. This avoids processing ACLs for resources that don't match the filter, further improving efficiency.

The final result is collected into a single list at the end, which is much more efficient than creating multiple intermediate sets. This change preserves the method's functionality while significantly improving its performance.
