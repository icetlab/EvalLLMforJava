The performance of expiring producer IDs can be improved by avoiding the use of streams, which create intermediate collections. The current implementation streams over all producers, collects the keys of expired producers into a list, and then iterates over this list to remove them from the map. This is inefficient.

I will refactor the `removeExpiredProducers` method to use `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This method iterates over the entries and removes the ones that match the predicate in a single pass, without creating any intermediate collections. This is significantly more efficient, especially for a large number of producers. As a cleanup, I will also remove the `removeProducerIds` method, which becomes unused after this change.
