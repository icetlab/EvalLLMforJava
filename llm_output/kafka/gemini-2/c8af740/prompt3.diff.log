The current implementation of `removeExpiredProducers` is inefficient for a large number of producers. It streams through all producer entries, filters the expired ones, collects their IDs into a new list, and then iterates over this list to remove them from the map. This process creates a potentially large intermediate list of producer IDs, leading to increased memory allocation and garbage collection overhead, which degrades performance.

To improve this, I will refactor `removeExpiredProducers` to use `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This allows for in-place removal of expired entries directly from the `producers` and `verificationStates` maps without creating intermediate collections. This change significantly reduces memory allocations and improves the overall performance of expiring producers, especially when the number of producers is large.

As a result of this refactoring, the private helper method `removeProducerIds` becomes obsolete and will be removed to clean up the codebase.
