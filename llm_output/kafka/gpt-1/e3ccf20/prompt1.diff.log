I’ve corrected the `matchingAclExists` replacement to include the proper braces and closing of the method, and kept the simplified `exists` logic. I’ve also retained the `ResourceOrdering` reverse-comparison change.

```json

    "search": "    acls.find { acl =>\n      acl.permissionType == permissionType &&\n        (acl.kafkaPrincipal == principal || acl.kafkaPrincipal == AclEntry.WildcardPrincipal) &&\n        (operation == acl.operation || acl.operation == AclOperation.ALL) &&\n        (acl.host == host || acl.host == AclEntry.WildcardHost)\n    }.exists { acl =>\n      authorizerLogger.debug(s\"operation = $operation on resource = $resource from host = $host is $permissionType based on acl = $acl\")\n      true\n    }\n  }",
    "replace": "    acls.exists { acl =>\n      val matches = acl.permissionType == permissionType &&\n        (acl.kafkaPrincipal == principal || acl.kafkaPrincipal == AclEntry.WildcardPrincipal) &&\n        (operation == acl.operation || acl.operation == AclOperation.ALL) &&\n        (acl.host == host || acl.host == AclEntry.WildcardHost)\n      if (matches) authorizerLogger.debug(s\"operation = $operation on resource = $resource from host = $host is $permissionType based on acl = $acl\")\n      matches\n    }\n  }"
  },
