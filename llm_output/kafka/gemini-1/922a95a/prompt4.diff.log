The performance issue is that `Partition.makeFollower()` can be blocked by ongoing log appends on a follower replica. This is because `makeFollower()` acquires a write lock on `leaderIsrUpdateLock`, while `appendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica()` (which handles follower appends) acquires a read lock on the same lock.

To resolve this, I will introduce a new `ReentrantReadWriteLock` called `futureLogLock`. This new lock will specifically manage concurrency for operations related to log directory alterations, which is the primary reason `appendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica` needed the original lock.

Here are the detailed changes:
1.  A new `futureLogLock` is added to the `Partition` class.
2.  `doAppendRecordsToFollowerOrFutureReplica` is modified to use `futureLogLock` for appends to the current log (`isFuture = false`), while continuing to use `leaderIsrUpdateLock` for appends to the future log (`isFuture = true`). This decouples the common follower append path from `makeFollower`.
3.  `truncateTo` and `truncateFullyAndStartAt` are updated to use this new conditional locking strategy, acquiring `futureLogLock` for operations on the current log and `leaderIsrUpdateLock` for the future log.
4.  `maybeReplaceCurrentWithFutureReplica`, which orchestrates the log swap, is updated to acquire both `leaderIsrUpdateLock` and `futureLogLock` (in that specific order to prevent deadlocks) to ensure atomicity and correctness during the swap.

These changes will prevent `makeFollower()` from being delayed by follower log appends, improving performance during leadership changes, such as in a controlled shutdown scenario.
