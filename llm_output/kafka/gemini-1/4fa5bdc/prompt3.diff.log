My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing critical code paths identified through analysis of the source code and the provided benchmark functions. The key areas for improvement are:

1.  **Prefixed ACL Matching:** The `matchingAcls` method, which is central to the `authorize` logic, contained an inefficient algorithm for finding ACLs on prefixed resources. The original implementation scanned a potentially large range of the `aclCache` `TreeMap`. I've replaced this with a much more efficient approach that iterates through the prefixes of the resource name and performs direct lookups in the cache. This changes the complexity from being proportional to a large range of cache entries to being proportional to the length of the resource name, which is significantly faster.

2.  **ACL Iteration:** The `acls` method, benchmarked by `testAclsIterator`, iterates over all ACLs in the cache. For the common case of fetching all ACLs (`AclBindingFilter.ANY`), the original implementation could cause multiple reallocations of its result `ArrayList`. My change detects this specific case, pre-calculates the total number of ACLs in a single pass, and pre-sizes the `ArrayList` accordingly, thus avoiding costly reallocations.

3.  **Authorization Logic Optimization:** Within the `authorizeAction` method, the `allowAclExists` helper function was creating new `Set` objects on every invocation to handle ACL inheritance rules (e.g., `READ` implies `DESCRIBE`). I've eliminated this unnecessary object creation by using pre-computed, static `Set`s stored in the companion object, reducing overhead in this frequently called authorization path.

These changes are designed to improve the performance of both ACL lookups and authorization checks, directly addressing the operations measured in the benchmarks, while preserving the original functionality as validated by the unit tests.
