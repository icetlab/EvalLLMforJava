The current implementation of `removeExpiredProducers` is inefficient. It iterates over all producers and verification states, collecting the keys of expired entries into intermediate lists. For producers, it then calls `producers.keySet().removeAll()`, which can be very slow (quadratic complexity in the worst case) when the argument is a `List`. For both producers and verification states, creating these intermediate lists introduces memory overhead, especially when a large number of entries have expired.

My improvement refactors the `removeExpiredProducers` method to use `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This approach iterates over the map entries and removes expired ones in a single pass, directly modifying the map. This avoids the creation of intermediate collections, reducing memory allocation, and provides a significant performance improvement by using an efficient, linear-time removal process. This change makes the private method `removeProducerIds` redundant, but it is left in place to keep the change atomic and focused on the performance improvement of `removeExpiredProducers`.
