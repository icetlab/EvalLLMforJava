The `acls()` method in `AclAuthorizer` constructs a list of all ACLs, which can be a performance-intensive operation, especially when dealing with a large number of ACLs. The original implementation iterates through all cached ACLs and, for each resource, creates new intermediate collections (`Set`s) during the mapping and filtering process. This leads to unnecessary object allocation and garbage collection overhead.

To improve performance, I will modify the `acls` method to use Scala's `view`. A `view` provides a lazy representation of a collection, meaning that operations like `flatMap`, `map`, and `filter` are not executed immediately. Instead, they are deferred until the elements of the resulting collection are actually accessed. This change avoids the creation of intermediate collections, reducing memory pressure and CPU usage, thereby making the ACL filtering process more efficient.
