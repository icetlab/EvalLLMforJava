My previous attempt to optimize ACL lookups for prefixed resources introduced a bug due to an incorrect assumption about the ordering of keys in the `aclCache`. The `takeWhile` condition was too aggressive and would prematurely terminate the search, causing valid ACLs to be missed and leading to the `testAuthorizeWithPrefixedResource` failure.

I have corrected this logic. The new implementation for finding prefixed ACLs now correctly handles the reverse lexicographical ordering of resource names in the cache. It uses `iteratorFrom` to start the search and a `takeWhile` clause that correctly prunes the search space by only considering resource names that start with the same character as the resource being authorized. This is followed by a `filter` step to ensure an exact prefix match. This approach is not only correct but also more efficient than iterating over a wider range of keys, as it stops as soon as it's clear no more potential prefixes can be found.

I've also retained the micro-optimizations from my previous attempt, which cache frequently used `Set` instances to reduce object allocations during authorization checks.
