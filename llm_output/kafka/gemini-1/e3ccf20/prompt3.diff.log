My overall improvement strategy focuses on two key performance areas highlighted by the benchmarks: ACL collection iteration and authorization logic for prefixed resources.

First, I'll optimize the `acls` method. The original implementation uses a `java.util.ArrayList`, which can be inefficient when adding a large number of elements due to its 50% growth strategy, leading to frequent reallocations. I will replace it with a Scala `mutable.ArrayBuffer`, which uses a more efficient doubling strategy for growth, reducing the number of memory copy operations.

Second, and more significantly, I will refactor the `matchingAcls` method. The original logic for finding ACLs on prefixed resources involved a potentially wide range scan on the underlying `TreeMap` cache, followed by filtering. This is inefficient, especially in scenarios with many prefixed resources that don't match the resource being authorized. My change replaces this range scan with a series of direct lookups. It generates all possible prefixes of the given resource name and performs a highly-efficient point lookup for each in the cache. This dramatically reduces the number of cache entries that need to be examined, leading to a substantial performance gain in the `authorize` method.
