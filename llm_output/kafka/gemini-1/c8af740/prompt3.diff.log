The performance of `ProducerStateManager.removeExpiredProducers` is suboptimal due to its use of streams to collect keys of expired producers into an intermediate list before removal. This approach is inefficient for a large number of producers, as it requires multiple passes over the data and allocates a potentially large list in memory.

My improvement addresses this by replacing the stream-based logic with `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This method iterates over the map entries only once and removes matching entries in-place, which significantly reduces memory allocation and processing time. This is particularly effective for scenarios with many producers, as tested in the provided benchmark.

The changes are:
1.  In `removeExpiredProducers`, the stream operations for both `producers` and `verificationStates` maps are replaced with `removeIf` calls. This provides a more direct and performant way to remove expired entries.
2.  The private helper method `removeProducerIds` becomes redundant after this refactoring and is removed to improve code clarity.
