My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the hot path of authorization checks in `AclAuthorizer`.

First, I will address an inefficiency and a bug in the lookup of prefixed ACLs. The existing implementation uses a range scan on a `TreeMap` that is both incorrect for certain prefixes (like single-character prefixes) and can be inefficient. I will replace this with a more robust and correct iteration logic that correctly finds all matching prefixed ACLs.

Second, I will introduce caching for sets of `AclOperation` that are created repeatedly within the `allowAclExists` method. This method is called during authorization checks for operations like `DESCRIBE` which can imply other operations. By pre-calculating and caching these sets as private fields, I will reduce object allocation and improve performance in this frequently executed code path.

These changes combined will make the authorization process faster and more reliable.
