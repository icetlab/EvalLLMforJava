The primary performance issue is the use of Scala's `Set.++` operation within the `authorize` method's critical path. This operation is inefficient for large sets, as it requires iterating over one set and adding its elements to the other, which involves repeated hash code calculations and lookups. The `authorize` method is invoked for every request, making this inefficiency a significant bottleneck.

My improvement strategy is to refactor the authorization logic to avoid merging ACL sets. Instead of creating a single large set of all applicable ACLs (prefixed, wildcard, and literal), I will modify the logic to check each of these ACL sets independently. This eliminates the expensive `++` operation. The authorization decision logic (`deny` takes precedence over `allow`) is preserved by first checking for any deny rules across all relevant ACL sets, and only if none are found, checking for an allow rule. This change is confined to the `authorizeAction` method and achieves the performance improvement without altering the authorizer's behavior.
