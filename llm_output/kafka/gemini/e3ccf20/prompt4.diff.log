The performance issue stems from the repeated creation of a large, merged `Set` of ACLs for each authorization check. The Scala `Set.++` operation, used to combine ACLs from wildcard, literal, and prefixed resource patterns, is inefficient for large sets as it involves iterating and hashing every element of the right-hand set.

My improvement strategy is to avoid this costly set-merging operation altogether. Instead of creating a single large set, I will modify the authorization logic to work with the individual ACL sets (prefixed, wildcard, and literal) directly. The authorization checks for `DENY` and `ALLOW` permissions will now iterate over a short list containing these three sets. This avoids the overhead of creating a new, large, merged set for every authorization request, significantly improving performance, especially when many ACLs are present.

This is achieved by:
1. Replacing the local helper functions within `authorizeAction` with a new `aclsAllowAccess` implementation that operates on separate ACL sets.
2. Modifying the `matchingAcls` function to return the three distinct ACL sets as a tuple, renaming it to `matchingAclSets` for clarity.

These changes preserve the original authorization logic while eliminating the expensive set-merging bottleneck.
