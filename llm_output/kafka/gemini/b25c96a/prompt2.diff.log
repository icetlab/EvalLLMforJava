The current implementation for expiring producer IDs in `ProducerStateManager` is inefficient. It iterates through all producers, collects the keys of expired producers into a list, and then removes them from the map. This process is repeated for verification state entries. This approach creates unnecessary intermediate collections and can be slow, especially with a large number of producers.

My improvement replaces this two-step process (collect then remove) with a more direct and efficient single-step removal using `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This method iterates over the map entries and removes those that match the provided predicate in-place, avoiding the overhead of creating temporary lists of keys to be removed. This change preserves the original logic while significantly improving performance by reducing object allocations and redundant iterations.
