My improvement strategy focuses on addressing the performance regression in the `matchingAcls` method, which occurs with a large number of topics and prefixed ACLs. The core issue is the eager evaluation and materialization of a potentially massive collection of ACLs, which I will fix by introducing laziness into the process.

My changes are twofold:
1.  In the `AclAuthorizer.AclSeqs` class, I will modify the `find` method to be lazy. Instead of strictly evaluating all ACL collections, it will now use a `view`. This ensures that it stops searching as soon as a matching ACL is found, which is particularly beneficial when the match is in one of the earlier collections.

2.  In the `matchingAcls` method, I will change how the `prefixed` ACL collection is constructed. The current implementation eagerly builds a buffer of all matching prefixed ACLs. I will alter this to use an `iterator` on the `TreeMap` slice, combined with a lazy `flatMap` operation, and then convert the result to a `LazyList`. This defers the traversal and filtering of prefixed ACLs until they are actually accessed, significantly reducing memory consumption and CPU usage when the set of potential matches is large.

Together, these changes ensure that the ACL authorization process is efficient even with a large number of ACLs, by processing them lazily and avoiding the creation of large intermediate collections.
