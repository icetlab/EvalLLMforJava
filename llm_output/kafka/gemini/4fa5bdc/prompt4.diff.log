The performance issue is due to the creation of a large, temporary `Set` for prefixed ACLs during authorization checks. In the `matchingAcls` method, all ACLs from matching prefixed resource patterns are collected into a single `Set`. For scenarios with many prefixed ACLs, this `toSet` operation is expensive and a performance bottleneck.

My improvement avoids this by changing how prefixed ACLs are collected and passed to the `AclSets` helper class. Instead of flattening all prefixed ACLs into one large set, I will modify the code to gather a sequence of smaller sets, one for each matching prefixed resource. This sequence, along with the wildcard and literal ACL sets, is then passed to the `AclSets` constructor. This avoids the costly creation of the large intermediate set, improving performance, especially when many prefixed ACLs are in use.
