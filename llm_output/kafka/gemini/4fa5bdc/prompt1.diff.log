My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing hot paths within the `AclAuthorizer` to reduce object allocations and improve lookup efficiency, which is critical for authorization-heavy workloads.

Specifically, I've made two main improvements:

1.  **Optimized `allowAclExists` function:** The original implementation created new `Set` objects for ACL operations on every authorization check. I've replaced this by pre-calculating and caching these sets as private `val`s within the `AclAuthorizer` class. This avoids repeated object allocation in the `authorizeAction` method, a very frequently called part of the code.

2.  **Efficient Prefixed ACL Lookup:** The logic for finding matching prefixed ACLs in `matchingAcls` previously used a combination of `from`, `to`, and `filterKeys` on an immutable `TreeMap`. This approach could be inefficient as it might create intermediate collections. I've replaced it with a more performant iterator-based approach using `iteratorFrom` and `takeWhile`. This lazily iterates over the cache and stops as soon as a non-matching prefix is found, significantly reducing overhead, especially in scenarios with many prefixed ACLs.

These changes are designed to enhance performance while strictly preserving the original authorization logic.
