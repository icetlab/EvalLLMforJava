My proposed improvement focuses on reducing object allocations within the `makeFollower` method and its callees. The provided benchmark, `PartitionMakeFollowerBenchmark`, specifically targets this method under lock contention. By optimizing collection transformations, we can decrease the time spent holding a write lock, which in turn enhances performance.

Here are the specific changes:
1.  In the `makeFollower` method, a redundant collection transformation (`.iterator.map(...).toSeq`) is simplified to a more direct `.map(...)`. This reduces intermediate object creation.
2.  In the `updateAssignmentAndIsr` method, which is called by `makeFollower`, a `filter(...).foreach(...)` chain is replaced with a single `foreach` containing an `if` condition. This common Scala optimization avoids allocating an intermediate collection for filtered results, reducing garbage collection pressure and improving efficiency.
