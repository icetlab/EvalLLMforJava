My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the `authorize` method, which is a critical hot path in the `AclAuthorizer`. The key improvements are:

1.  **Reducing Object Allocation and Set Merging:** The original implementation collected all matching ACLs (literal, wildcard, and prefixed) into a single large `Set` for every authorization check. This involved creating multiple intermediate sets and then merging them, which can be inefficient, especially with a large number of prefixed ACLs. My change refactors this logic to evaluate each type of ACL set (literal, wildcard, prefixed) independently without merging them. This avoids the overhead of creating a large, merged set on every call, reducing both memory allocation and CPU usage. The short-circuiting behavior of logical operators (`||`, `&&`) is leveraged to stop evaluation as soon as an outcome is determined, further improving performance.

2.  **Caching Implicitly Granted Operations:** The logic for handling implicit permissions (e.g., `READ` implying `DESCRIBE`) involved creating new `Set` objects on each invocation. I've replaced this with pre-allocated, static `Set` instances in the companion object. This is a micro-optimization that reduces object churn in the `authorize` hot path.

These changes preserve the original authorization logic while making it more efficient.
