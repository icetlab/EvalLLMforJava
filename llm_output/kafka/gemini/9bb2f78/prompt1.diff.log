My overall improvement strategy is to enhance the performance of the `ReplaceField` transformation by optimizing field filtering. The original implementation uses `java.util.List` for the `exclude` and `include` configurations. Checking for field existence in these lists with `List.contains()` has a linear time complexity of O(n), which can be inefficient when processing records with many fields or when the include/exclude lists are large.

To address this, I will replace the `List` collections with `java.util.Set`. This change will reduce the time complexity of the `contains()` check to O(1) on average, significantly speeding up the `filter` method, which is a critical part of the transformation logic called for every field. I will use fully qualified names for `Set` and `HashSet` to avoid modifying the import statements, keeping the changes minimal and focused.

  }
