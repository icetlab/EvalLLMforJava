My overall improvement strategy is to enhance the performance of the `ReplaceField` transformation, particularly when handling a large number of fields in its `include` and `exclude` configurations. The current implementation uses `List.contains()`, which has a linear time complexity (O(n)). This becomes a bottleneck with many configured fields.

To address this, I will change the data structures for the `exclude` and `include` field lists from `java.util.List` to `java.util.Set`. By using `java.util.HashSet`, the `contains()` check will have an average time complexity of O(1), providing a significant performance boost for the scenarios highlighted in the benchmark.

The changes are broken down into two parts:
1.  Modifying the field declarations for `exclude` and `include` to use `java.util.Set`.
2.  Updating the `configure` method to initialize these fields as `java.util.HashSet` instances.

I will use fully-qualified class names to avoid a separate change for adding new imports, ensuring each change is as self-contained as possible.
