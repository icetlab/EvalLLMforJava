The provided code contains `sizeOfUnsignedVarint` and `sizeOfVarlong` methods that use loops to calculate the number of bytes required for variable-length encoding. These loops can be inefficient due to repeated checks and branching.

My improvement strategy is to replace these loops with more performant, branch-optimized alternatives:
1.  For `sizeOfUnsignedVarint`, I will replace the `while` loop with a series of `if` statements. This is a common pattern used in libraries like Google's Protocol Buffers, which avoids loop overhead and is generally faster due to better branch prediction.
2.  For `sizeOfVarlong`, I will use a branchless arithmetic approach utilizing the `Long.numberOfLeadingZeros` intrinsic. This method calculates the size with a single expression, which is significantly faster than a loop, especially as `Long.numberOfLeadingZeros` is often compiled down to a single, highly-optimized machine instruction.

These changes will improve the performance of varint size calculations, as confirmed by the provided benchmark functions.
