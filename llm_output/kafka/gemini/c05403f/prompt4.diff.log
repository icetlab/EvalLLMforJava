The previous change improved performance by unrolling the loops in `sizeOfUnsignedVarint` and `sizeOfVarlong` into a series of `if` statements. However, this increased the NPath complexity of `sizeOfVarlong` beyond the allowed limit, causing a build failure.

This new approach fixes the issue by using a more efficient, non-iterative method to calculate the size of variable-length integers. It leverages `Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros` and `Long.numberOfLeadingZeros` intrinsics to determine the number of bits in the value, and from that, calculates the number of bytes required for varint/varlong encoding. This method is faster than the original loop and has a very low complexity, thus resolving the checkstyle error and maintaining the performance gain.
