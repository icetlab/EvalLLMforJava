The overall improvement intent is to optimize the `removeExpiredProducers` method. The original implementation iterates over all producers, collects the keys of expired producers into a new list, and then iterates over this new list to remove them from the map. This is inefficient, especially when a large number of producers have expired, as it requires extra memory for the list of keys and involves multiple iterations.

The proposed change refactors this logic to use `Map.entrySet().removeIf()`. This allows for in-place removal of expired entries from the `producers` and `verificationStates` maps during a single iteration, which is more memory-efficient and performant by avoiding the creation of intermediate collections.
