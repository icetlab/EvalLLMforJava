The `acls()` method in `AclAuthorizer` iterates over all ACLs to find those matching a given filter. The original implementation uses `map` followed by `filter` on a `Set` of ACLs for each resource. This approach is inefficient as it creates an intermediate `Set` for the result of the `map` operation, which is then filtered to create another `Set`. This leads to unnecessary object allocations and can degrade performance, especially with a large number of ACLs.

To improve performance, I will introduce a lazy `view` to the operation. By calling `.view` on the `Set` of ACLs, the subsequent `map` and `filter` operations become lazy and do not create intermediate collections. Instead, they create lightweight view objects that represent the transformations. The transformations are only applied when the final collection is consumed, effectively fusing the operations and avoiding the creation of intermediate sets. This change reduces memory pressure and improves the overall performance of the `acls()` method.
