The `acls` method in `AclAuthorizer` previously created intermediate collections when mapping and filtering ACLs. This could lead to performance degradation due to unnecessary object allocations and garbage collection pressure, especially with a large number of ACLs.

My improvement introduces lazy evaluation by using `.view` on the collections before applying `flatMap`, `map`, and `filter` operations. This change ensures that intermediate collections are not created. The operations are fused and executed only when the resulting `Iterable` is consumed, which significantly improves performance by reducing memory allocations.
