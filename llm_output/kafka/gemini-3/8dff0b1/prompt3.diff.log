My overall improvement strategy focuses on two key areas within the `AclAuthorizer` to enhance its performance during authorization checks:

1.  **Optimizing Prefixed ACL Matching:** The original implementation for finding matching prefixed ACLs involved creating an intermediate `SortedMap` via `filterKeys`. This can be inefficient due to the allocation and population of this temporary collection, especially when the number of potential prefixed ACLs to scan is large. My change replaces this with a more direct, iterator-based approach. By iterating over a view of the `TreeMap` (`aclCache`), I avoid creating the intermediate collection, reducing memory allocations and CPU overhead.

2.  **Reducing ACL Set Iterations:** For operations like `DESCRIBE`, which inherit permissions from other operations (e.g., `READ`, `WRITE`), the original code would iterate through the entire set of applicable ACLs multiple times (once for each operation in the inheritance chain). I've refactored the logic to perform only a single pass over the ACL set, checking for any of the required `allow` operations. This significantly reduces redundant work, especially when many ACLs are present for a given resource. This change involves rewriting `allowAclExists`, inlining the logic of `matchingAclExists` into `denyAclExists`, and then removing the now-unused `matchingAclExists` method.

These changes will improve the latency of authorization decisions, which is a critical path in Kafka.
