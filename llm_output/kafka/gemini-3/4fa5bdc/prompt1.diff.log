My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the hot path within the `AclAuthorizer.authorize` method, which is executed for every authorization request. The key performance enhancements are:

1.  **Eliminating Object Allocations in `allowAclExists`**: The `allowAclExists` method, which checks for inherited permissions, previously created new `Set` objects on each invocation for `DESCRIBE` and `DESCRIBE_CONFIGS` operations. By replacing these with pre-allocated, static `Set`s stored in the companion object, we avoid unnecessary object creation and garbage collection pressure in a frequently called method.

2.  **Avoiding Intermediate Collection Creation**: The `matchingAcls` method calculates matching prefixed ACLs by iterating over a view of the ACL cache. The result was eagerly converted to a `Set`, creating a new collection on every authorization check. I've modified this to work with a lazy `Iterable`, avoiding the costly `.toSet` operation.

3.  **Introducing Lazy Evaluation in `AclSets`**: To support the change above and further improve performance, the internal `AclSets` helper class has been updated. Its `find` method now uses a lazy `view` on the collections of ACLs. This ensures that it stops searching as soon as a matching ACL is found, rather than iterating through all possible ACLs, which is particularly beneficial when an early match occurs.

These changes collectively reduce object allocation, minimize collection processing, and introduce laziness in critical sections, leading to a more performant authorization process.
