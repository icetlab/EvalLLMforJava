The primary performance issue is in the `authorize` method, specifically within the `matchingAcls` helper function. For every authorization check, this function constructs a `Set` of all potentially matching prefixed ACLs. This involves iterating over a range of the `aclCache`, filtering, and collecting the results into a new `Set`. When the number of prefixed ACLs is large, this process is inefficient due to the repeated creation of large, temporary collections.

My improvement focuses on eliminating this unnecessary `Set` creation. I've modified the `AclSets` helper class to accept `Iterable[AclEntry]` instead of `Set[AclEntry]`. This allows `matchingAcls` to pass a lazy `Iterable` of prefixed ACLs without materializing it into a `Set`. The `AclSets.find` method is also updated to use a view-based approach (`view.flatMap(...).headOption`), ensuring that it can efficiently and lazily find a matching ACL without traversing all the ACLs if a match is found early. This change significantly reduces object allocation and CPU usage during authorization, especially in scenarios with many prefixed ACLs. This also corrects a build error from the previous attempt which used a method not available in the project's Scala version.
