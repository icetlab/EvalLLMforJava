The performance of producer ID expiration is improved by using `Map.entrySet().removeIf()` to remove expired entries from the `producers` and `verificationStates` maps. This avoids creating intermediate lists of keys to be removed, which reduces memory allocation and improves efficiency by performing removal in a single pass over the maps. This change is particularly effective when there are many producers, as it avoids iterating over the full list of producers multiple times.
