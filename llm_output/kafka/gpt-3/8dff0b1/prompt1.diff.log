I have made targeted micro-optimizations to reduce unnecessary allocations and logging overhead:

1. Replaced the two-step `find(...).exists` in `matchingAclExists` with a single `exists` call to avoid creating an intermediate `Option`.
2. Guarded debug logging with `isDebugEnabled` checks to prevent string interpolation when debug logging is disabled.
