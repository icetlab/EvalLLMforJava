My analysis indicates that the `shiftLeftFromSpecifiedPosition` method can be significantly optimized. The current implementation involves converting an integer to a byte array, performing a `System.arraycopy`, and then converting the byte array back to an integer. This process introduces overhead from object allocation (`byte[]`) and multiple method calls.

My proposed improvement replaces this entire sequence with a pure bitwise manipulation approach. This avoids heap allocation and operates directly on the integer's bit representation, which is substantially faster. The logic involves:
1.  Creating masks to isolate the portions of the integer that should be preserved.
2.  Creating a mask for the portion that needs to be shifted.
3.  Shifting the original integer left by 8 bits (one byte) and applying the middle mask to get the new byte values in their target positions.
4.  Combining the preserved parts with the shifted part using bitwise OR.

To ensure full functional equivalence with the original code, including its exception-throwing behavior for invalid arguments, I've added a check for out-of-bounds parameters. For such cases, I delegate to `System.arraycopy` with a dummy array to precisely replicate the original exception behavior, satisfying the requirement to preserve functionality while optimizing the common-case execution path.
