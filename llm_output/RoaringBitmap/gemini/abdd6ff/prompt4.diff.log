The performance issue is related to the removal of top values, specifically in the `topK` method of `BitSliceIndexBase`. The existing implementation for handling ties (when more than `k` values are found) is inefficient. It iterates through the result set `F` and builds a new bitmap `turnoff` one element at a time, which is then used in an `andNot` operation. This approach is slow, especially for large `k`.

Furthermore, the original implementation has a correctness issue. It removes the smallest column IDs from the combined result set `F`, which can incorrectly remove columns that are guaranteed to be in the top-K set (those in `G`). The correct approach is to remove excess elements only from the set of "ties" (`E`).

My improvement addresses both issues:
1.  **Performance**: I replaced the manual iteration with `MutableRoaringBitmap.limit(n)`. This method is highly optimized to create a new bitmap containing the first `n` elements, which is significantly faster than iterating and adding elements one by one.
2.  **Correctness**: I've adjusted the logic to ensure that elements are removed from the correct bitmap. If `G` (guaranteed top values) is empty, `F` and `E` (ties) are the same, so we can trim `F`. If `G` is not empty, we must only trim from `E` to preserve the guaranteed top values. This ensures the returned set truly represents the top `k` values.

This change not only improves performance as requested but also fixes a latent bug in the `topK` algorithm's implementation.
