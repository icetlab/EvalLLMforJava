The change removes the initial retained‐size calculation in the constructor of ProjectSelectedPositions so that we don’t account page memory at construction time (before any pages are produced), avoiding unnecessary work and memory updates when the page isn’t retained for further processing.

    "search": "this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];\n            updateRetainedSize();",
    "replace": "this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];"
  }
]
