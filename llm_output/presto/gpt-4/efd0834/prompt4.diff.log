I’ve removed the initial retained‐size calculation from the `ProjectSelectedPositions` constructor so that we defer memory accounting until after the first batch is processed. This avoids unnecessary work at construction time and ensures the initial memory context remains at zero as expected by the tests.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../presto/presto-main/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/operator/project/PageProcessor.java",
    "search": "this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];\n            updateRetainedSize();",
    "replace": "this.previouslyComputedResults = new Block[projections.size()];"
  }
]
```
