I have modified the projection method to pre-allocate each BlockBuilder to the expected number of entries (based on the selected positions), avoiding repeated resizing during projection.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../presto/presto-main/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/operator/project/GeneratedPageProjection.java",
    "search": "        blockBuilders = blockBuilders.stream().map(blockBuilder -> blockBuilder.newBlockBuilderLike(null)).collect(toImmutableList());",
    "replace": "        int expectedEntries = selectedPositions.size();\n        blockBuilders = projections.stream()\n            .map(expression -> expression.getType().createBlockBuilder(null, expectedEntries))\n            .collect(toImmutableList());"
  }
]
```
