The `ST_Intersects` function can be optimized by first checking for the intersection of the geometries' bounding boxes (envelopes). This is a common spatial optimization technique. If the envelopes do not intersect, the geometries themselves cannot intersect, allowing for a quick `false` return without performing the more computationally expensive full geometry intersection check.

This optimization involves:
1.  Deserializing only the envelopes of the two input geometries. This is significantly faster than deserializing the entire geometry data.
2.  Performing a lightweight check to see if these envelopes intersect.
3.  If they do not intersect, the function returns `false` immediately.
4.  Only if the envelopes do intersect does the function proceed with the full, more costly, geometry deserialization and intersection test.

This change will provide a significant performance improvement for cases where geometries are not close to each other, a scenario specifically tested in the provided benchmarks.
