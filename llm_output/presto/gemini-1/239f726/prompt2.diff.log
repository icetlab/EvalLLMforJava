The `ST_Intersects` function is optimized by introducing a bounding box intersection check. This check serves as a fast, preliminary filter. If the bounding boxes of the two geometries do not intersect, the geometries themselves cannot intersect, and the function can return `false` immediately. This avoids the more computationally expensive, detailed geometry intersection analysis for many pairs of geometries, especially those that are far apart. The implementation is also careful to deserialize each geometry only once, improving efficiency over other similar functions in the file which suffer from redundant deserializations.
