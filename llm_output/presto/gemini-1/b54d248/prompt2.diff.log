My proposed improvement for `HashGenerator.getPartition` focuses on optimizing the modulo operation, which is known to be computationally expensive. The key idea is to detect when the `partitionCount` is a power of two. In such cases, the modulo operation (`%`) can be replaced with a much faster bitwise AND operation (`&`). This is a common and effective optimization used in hash-based data structures like `HashMap`.

Since partition counts are frequently powers of two in distributed systems for balanced distribution, this change will often hit the fast path. I've also included a check to ensure `partitionCount` is positive to maintain correctness for the power-of-two calculation, making the method robust even if called with invalid arguments.
