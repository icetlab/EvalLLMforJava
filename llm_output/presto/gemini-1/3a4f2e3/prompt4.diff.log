The primary performance issue is the `readNoFilter` method's inefficiency when processing contiguous rows without nulls. The original implementation checks for and potentially performs a stream skip for every single row, even when they are contiguous. This adds unnecessary overhead.

My improvement introduces a fast path for the common case of reading a contiguous block of rows where no null values are present (`presentStream` is null).

1.  **Detect Contiguous Rows**: I've added a check `positions[positionCount - 1] - positions[0] == positionCount - 1` to quickly determine if the requested positions form a contiguous block. This check is safe because `read()` validates that `positionCount` is greater than zero.

2.  **Optimized Skip**: In the fast path, a single `skip()` operation is performed at the beginning to advance the stream to the start of the contiguous block.

3.  **Loop Optimization**: The main loop for reading values is now free of the conditional `skip()` logic, which significantly reduces per-row overhead. It now only reads the boolean values from the data stream.

This change specifically targets the scenario described in the performance issue, providing a significant speed-up for that case while retaining the original logic for all other scenarios (non-contiguous rows or rows with potential nulls).
