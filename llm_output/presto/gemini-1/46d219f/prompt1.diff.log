The overall improvement intent is to optimize the `map_concat` function by reducing memory allocations.

The primary change focuses on correcting the initial capacity of the `BlockBuilder` used to construct the resulting map. The `InterleavedBlockBuilder`'s constructor expects the number of entries (key-value pairs), but it was being initialized with the total number of positions (keys plus values), which is twice the number of entries. This led to an over-allocation of memory for the internal buffers of the `BlockBuilder`. By providing the correct number of entries, we reduce the function's peak memory footprint, which can improve performance by reducing GC pressure and improving cache efficiency.
