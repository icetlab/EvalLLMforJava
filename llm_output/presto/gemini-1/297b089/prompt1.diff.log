The current implementation of `SliceDirectSelectiveStreamReader` unconditionally uses batch processing mode by having `useBatchMode` always return `true`. This can be inefficient for sparse reads where many rows are skipped, as it leads to reading and buffering unnecessary data. Additionally, this blanket approach is incorrect for fixed-width `CHAR` and `VARCHAR(n)` types which require truncation that is not performed in the batch path.

My improvement re-enables and refines the logic within the `useBatchMode` method. The updated logic decides whether to use batch mode based on the following:
1.  **Correctness for Truncatable Types**: It disables batch mode for `CHAR` and `VARCHAR(n)` types (`maxCodePointCount >= 0`), ensuring that value truncation is correctly handled in the non-batch path. It also disables batch mode if the length stream is not present, avoiding potential issues.
2.  **Performance Heuristics**: It uses a heuristic based on `inputFilterRate` (the proportion of rows being skipped) to select the most performant read path. For reads without a filter, batch mode is used for dense reads (at least 50% of rows). For reads with a filter, it uses empirically determined ranges of `inputFilterRate` where batch mode is more performant, avoiding it for sparse reads and specific intermediate densities where non-batch I/O is faster.

This change improves performance by reducing I/O and memory usage for sparse reads and ensures correctness for types requiring truncation.
