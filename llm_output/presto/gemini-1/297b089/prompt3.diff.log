The current implementation of `SliceDirectSelectiveStreamReader` forces the use of batch mode for reading data by always returning `true` from the `useBatchMode` method. This can be inefficient and, in some cases, incorrect.

My improvement involves re-instating the original, more nuanced logic within `useBatchMode`. This logic was present in the source file but commented out.

The key improvements are:
1.  **Correctness for Bounded Types:** Batch mode is now disabled for `CHAR(n)` and `VARCHAR(n)` types (`maxCodePointCount >= 0`). The batch processing path does not handle the required truncation for these types, which could lead to incorrect data being read. The non-batch path correctly computes truncated lengths.
2.  **Performance Optimization:** The restored logic uses an `inputFilterRate` to decide whether to use batch mode. When reading a sparse selection of rows (high filter rate), batch mode can be inefficient as it reads and buffers data for all rows in a range, much of which is then discarded. By switching to a row-by-row approach in such cases, we can significantly reduce memory allocation and improve performance, especially for queries with selective filters. The specific thresholds for `inputFilterRate` appear to be tuned based on empirical performance data.

By restoring this logic, the reader will make more intelligent decisions, leading to better performance and correctness across a wider range of query patterns and data types.
