The performance of `WindowOperator` can be improved by optimizing the `findEndPosition` method. This method uses a binary search to find the end of a group of equal elements. The existing implementation is correct, but it can be made more efficient.

The current binary search implementation is slightly suboptimal. A more standard and aggressive `lower_bound`-style binary search can reduce the number of comparisons, especially for larger groups. The key observation is that the element at `startPosition` is always part of the group, so we can start the binary search from `startPosition + 1`. By updating the lower bound of the search space to `middle + 1` when a match is found, we can narrow down the search range more quickly than the original implementation, which uses `left = middle`. This leads to fewer iterations and better performance, particularly when dealing with large partitions that have long runs of identical values.

I will replace the existing binary search logic in `findEndPosition` with this more efficient version. This change preserves the method's functionality while improving its performance.
