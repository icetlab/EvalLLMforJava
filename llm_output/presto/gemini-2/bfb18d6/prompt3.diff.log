My overall improvement strategy is to enhance the `stIntersection` function's performance and consistency.

First, I will add a standard optimization to `stIntersection` that is present in other spatial relationship functions in this file. I will add a check for the intersection of the geometries' bounding boxes (envelopes). If the envelopes do not intersect, the geometries cannot intersect, and we can return an empty geometry without performing the more expensive full intersection calculation. This will significantly speed up queries involving disjoint geometries. For the empty geometry, I will return an empty `OGCConcreteGeometryCollection`, which is what the underlying ESRI library produces for disjoint intersections.

Second, I will improve the consistency of the `EMPTY_POLYGON` constant. Currently, it is a JTS-serialized slice, while most other geometry-producing functions in this file, including those that use this constant, return ESRI-serialized slices. I will change `EMPTY_POLYGON` to be an ESRI-serialized empty polygon. This makes the code more consistent and avoids potential issues with mixed serialization formats.

These changes will improve performance for disjoint geometry intersections and enhance code consistency without altering the logic for intersecting geometries, thus preserving correctness for the benchmarked scenarios.
