My overall improvement intent is to enhance the robustness of the adaptive batch sizing logic and apply a minor code cleanup for better performance and readability.

First, I will make the batch size doubling logic more robust by using `Math.min` to cap the new batch size at `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`. This prevents the batch size from exceeding the maximum allowed value, which could happen with the original logic under certain conditions (e.g., if `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` is not a power of two). This change improves correctness and prevents potentially inefficient, oversized batches.

Second, I will replace a for-loop that nullifies the elements of the `previouslyComputedResults` array with a call to `Arrays.fill`. This is a standard Java practice that is more concise and can be slightly more performant as it may be implemented with an intrinsic JVM optimization.
