The performance of `WindowOperator.findEndPosition` can be improved by using a galloping search (also known as exponential search) to narrow down the search range before applying binary search.

The existing implementation uses a binary search over the entire remaining data (`[startPosition, endPosition)`). This is efficient with `O(log N)` complexity, where `N` is the size of the search space. However, in many real-world scenarios, groups of identical rows (partitions or peer groups) are often small relative to the total number of rows.

A galloping search is more adaptive to the size of the group. It first finds a range `[searchStart, searchEnd)` that contains the end of the group by making progressively larger jumps. For small groups, this range is found quickly with `O(log k)` comparisons, where `k` is the group size. A standard binary search is then performed only within this much smaller range.

This change will be particularly beneficial when dealing with data that has many small groups, as it reduces the number of comparisons against a potentially expensive `comparator`. For very large groups that span most of the data, the performance will be comparable to the original binary search, with a small overhead for the initial galloping phase. Overall, this leads to a more robust and often faster implementation for finding group boundaries.
