The overall improvement intent is to optimize the binary search algorithm used for finding group boundaries within the `WindowOperator`. The existing implementation, while correct, is slightly unconventional. By replacing it with a more standard and widely recognized `lower_bound`-style binary search, we can potentially achieve a minor performance gain. The standard implementation can reduce the search space more effectively in certain scenarios, which may lead to fewer iterations, especially with larger data partitions. This change also improves code readability and maintainability by adhering to a more common pattern.
