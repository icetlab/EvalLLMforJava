The performance issue is that `PageProcessor` performs memory accounting at construction time, which is unnecessary because it will be immediately asked to process a page. The retained memory calculation can be deferred until a page is actually produced or when the processor's state changes in a way that affects memory usage.

My improvement is to remove the call to `updateRetainedSize()` from the constructor of the inner class `ProjectSelectedPositions`. This avoids the upfront cost of calculating the retained size of the input page. The memory accounting will be performed later within the `process()` method, just before a result page is returned, which is when the retained memory information is actually needed. This change aligns with the principle of deferring work until necessary and eliminates redundant computations.
