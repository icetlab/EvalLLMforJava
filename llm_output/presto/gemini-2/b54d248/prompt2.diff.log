My improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the `getPartition` method within the `HashGenerator` interface. The primary performance bottleneck in the original implementation is the use of the modulo operator (`%`), which is known to be computationally more expensive than bitwise operations.

My change introduces a "fast path" for a common and performance-critical scenario: when the number of partitions (`partitionCount`) is a power of two. In this case, the modulo operation (`rawHash % partitionCount`) is mathematically equivalent to a bitwise AND operation (`rawHash & (partitionCount - 1)`). The bitwise AND is significantly faster.

The improved code first checks if `partitionCount` is a positive power of two. If it is, the partition is calculated using the faster bitwise AND, and the result is returned immediately. For all other cases (non-power-of-two partition counts, or invalid inputs like zero or negative counts), the code falls back to the original logic. This approach preserves the existing behavior and correctness for all inputs while providing a substantial performance boost for the common power-of-two case.
