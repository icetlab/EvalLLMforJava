My proposed improvement for `HashGenerator.java` is to optimize the `getPartition` method. The current implementation uses the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the partition, which can be computationally expensive.

My change introduces a fast path for cases where the `partitionCount` is a power of two. In such scenarios, the modulo operation can be replaced with a much faster bitwise AND operation (`&`). This is a common and effective optimization for hashing and partitioning algorithms, as partition counts are frequently chosen to be powers of two.

To maintain correctness and avoid behavior changes for edge cases (e.g., negative or zero `partitionCount`), the original logic, including the `checkState`, is preserved for partition counts that are not a power of two. This ensures that the optimization is applied only when it is guaranteed to be correct and that the original behavior is fully preserved otherwise.
