The `getPartition` method in `HashGenerator` is optimized. The modulo operation (`%`) is replaced with a bitwise AND (`&`) when the `partitionCount` is a power of two. This is a common performance optimization as bitwise operations are significantly faster than division/modulo. Additionally, the redundant `checkState` call is removed, as the logic for calculating the partition number already guarantees that the result is within the valid range. This avoids an unnecessary check and potential method call overhead.
