The `map_concat` function can be optimized by handling cases where one of the input maps is empty. When an input map is empty, we can avoid creating a new map and copying elements by returning the other map block directly. This is safe because `Block` instances are immutable.

Specifically:
1.  If `rightMap` is empty, the result of the concatenation is simply `leftMap`. We can return `leftMap` without any further processing.
2.  If `leftMap` is empty, the result is `rightMap`. We can return `rightMap` directly.

These changes prevent unnecessary allocation of `TypedSet` and `BlockBuilder`, and avoid iterating and copying block elements, leading to significant performance gains when dealing with empty maps.

Additionally, I've corrected the initial capacity provided to `TypedSet`. A map's `positionCount` is twice the number of its key-value pairs. Since `TypedSet` stores only the keys, its expected size should be `rightMap.getPositionCount() / 2`, which leads to more efficient memory allocation for the underlying hash set.
