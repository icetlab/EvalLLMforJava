My overall improvement strategy is to optimize the `getPartition` method in the `HashGenerator` interface. The current implementation uses a modulo operation which can be slow.

My changes achieve this by:
1.  Adding a special path for when `partitionCount` is a power of two. In this common case, the expensive modulo operation is replaced with a much faster bitwise AND operation. This also avoids the need to clear the sign bit of the hash.
2.  For the general case (when `partitionCount` is not a power of two), the logic is preserved, but I've removed a redundant `checkState` call. The preceding logic already guarantees that the partition number is within the valid range, so this check is unnecessary overhead.

These changes make the partition calculation more efficient, especially for power-of-two partition counts, while preserving the correctness of the original logic.
