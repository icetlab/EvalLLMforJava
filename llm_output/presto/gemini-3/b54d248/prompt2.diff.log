My proposed change optimizes the `getPartition` method in the `HashGenerator` interface. The original implementation had two performance bottlenecks for a method called in a tight loop: an expensive `long` modulo operation and a redundant `checkState` call.

My improvements are:
1.  **Fast path for power-of-two partitions:** I've added a check to see if `partitionCount` is a power of two. If it is, the expensive modulo operation (`%`) is replaced with a much faster bitwise AND (`&`). This is a common optimization as partition counts are often chosen to be powers of two.
2.  **Removal of redundant check:** The `checkState` call was redundant because after clearing the sign bit of the hash, the result of the modulo operation is guaranteed to be within the valid partition range (`[0, partitionCount - 1]`). Removing this check eliminates a method call and conditional logic from every invocation.

These changes maintain the original partitioning logic, ensuring that functionality remains identical while significantly improving performance.
