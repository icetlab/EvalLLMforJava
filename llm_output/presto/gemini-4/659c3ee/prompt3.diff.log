My overall improvement strategy is to optimize the `ByteSelectiveStreamReader` for common access patterns and simplify logical conditions.

First, I will enhance the fast path in the `readNoFilter` method. The original code had a fast path for reading contiguous data, but its condition was overly restrictive, only matching the very first batch of data in a file (`positions[0] == 0`). I will relax this condition to correctly identify any contiguous block of rows, which significantly improves performance for sequential scans over non-null data by using bulk read operations more frequently.

Second, I will simplify a conditional check within the `readWithFilter` method. The original condition for handling null values was unnecessarily complex: `(nonDeterministicFilter && filter.testNull()) || nullsAllowed`. A logical analysis reveals this is equivalent to simply `nullsAllowed`. This change cleans up the code and may offer a minor performance benefit by avoiding redundant checks.

These changes will improve read performance, especially for queries involving sequential scans, without altering the correctness of the output.
