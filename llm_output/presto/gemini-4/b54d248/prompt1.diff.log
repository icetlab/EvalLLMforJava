My analysis of the `HashGenerator.java` file indicates a performance improvement opportunity in the `getPartition` method. This method uses the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate a partition index from a hash value. While correct, the modulo operation can be computationally expensive, especially when executed in a tight loop for every row of data, which is a common scenario in Presto's partitioned operators.

A well-known optimization is to replace the modulo operation with a faster bitwise AND operation when the divisor (in this case, `partitionCount`) is a power of two. For a positive integer `n` that is a power of two, `x % n` is equivalent to `x & (n - 1)`.

My change introduces a fast-path check to see if `partitionCount` is a power of two. If it is, the more performant bitwise AND is used. If not, it falls back to the original modulo operation. This ensures correctness while providing a significant performance boost for the common case where partition counts are configured to be powers of two (like the 512 used in the provided tests). The change is self-contained within the `getPartition` method and maintains the original behavior for all other cases.
