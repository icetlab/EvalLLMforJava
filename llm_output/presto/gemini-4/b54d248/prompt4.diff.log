My optimization strategy is to improve the performance of the `getPartition` method in the `HashGenerator` interface. The modulo operator (`%`) on `long` values can be computationally expensive compared to bitwise operations.

A common performance optimization is to replace the modulo operation with a bitwise AND when the divisor is a power of two. For any non-negative number `x` and a power-of-two `n`, `x % n` is equivalent to `x & (n - 1)`.

I will modify `getPartition` to first check if `partitionCount` is a positive power of two. If it is, the partition will be calculated using the faster bitwise AND. If not, it will fall back to the original modulo operation. This change preserves the existing logic and functionality while providing a significant performance boost in common scenarios where the number of partitions is a power of two.
