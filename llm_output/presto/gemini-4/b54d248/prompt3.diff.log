My proposed improvement focuses on optimizing the `getPartition` method within the `HashGenerator` interface. The original implementation consistently uses the modulo operator (`%`) for partitioning, which can be computationally expensive.

My change introduces a specialized, faster path for cases where the partition count is a power of two. In such scenarios, the modulo operation is replaced with a significantly faster bitwise AND operation. This is a well-known optimization for hash-based partitioning. Since the provided test suite uses a partition count of 512 (which is 2^9), this optimization will be directly beneficial.

Additionally, I have removed a redundant `checkState` call. The logic for calculating the partition index, both in the original code and my optimized version, inherently guarantees that the resulting partition number will always be within the valid range, making the check unnecessary and adding a small overhead.
