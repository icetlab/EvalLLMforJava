The overall improvement is to enhance `GeneratedPageProjection` performance by pre-allocating memory for output `BlockBuilder`s. Previously, `BlockBuilder`s were created with a small default capacity, which could lead to multiple re-allocations and data copies when projecting a large number of rows. The change modifies the `project` method to initialize `BlockBuilder`s with an expected size based on the number of positions to be processed. This proactive memory reservation minimizes internal buffer resizing within `BlockBuilder`s, thus improving projection efficiency.
