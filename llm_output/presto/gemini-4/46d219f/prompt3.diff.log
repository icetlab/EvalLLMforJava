My analysis of the `MapConcatFunction` reveals that the initial capacity for both the `TypedSet` and the result `BlockBuilder` is oversized. The `TypedSet` is used to store keys from the right map, so its expected size should be half of `rightMap.getPositionCount()`. Similarly, the `InterleavedBlockBuilder` for the resulting map is initialized with the total number of positions from both maps, which is twice the actual maximum number of entries (key-value pairs).

By providing more accurate size hints, we can reduce memory allocation, which in turn lessens garbage collection pressure and can lead to better overall performance, especially for large maps. The proposed changes adjust these initial capacities to their correct, smaller values without altering the function's logic.
