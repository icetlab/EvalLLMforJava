This change aims to optimize the `findEndPosition` method in `WindowOperator`. The original implementation uses a binary search over the entire range of positions. While efficient, its performance can degrade if the range is large and the actual group of identical rows is small, due to poor cache locality and unnecessary comparisons.

The proposed improvement introduces a galloping search (also known as exponential search) to first quickly identify a smaller range where the group boundary is likely to be. This is particularly effective when dealing with large partitions where groups of identical rows are relatively small. The galloping search probes exponentially increasing distances from the start position. Once it finds a position outside the group, a standard binary search is performed only within the narrowed-down range. This hybrid approach adapts to different data distributions, offering significant performance gains for skewed data with many small groups within a large partition, while maintaining similar performance for large groups.
