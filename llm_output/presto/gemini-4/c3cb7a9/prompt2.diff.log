The `findEndPosition` method is used to locate the boundaries of groups of identical rows. The original implementation employed a binary search across the entire remaining data partition. This approach can be suboptimal when group sizes are small compared to the overall partition size, as it performs more comparisons than necessary.

To improve performance, I have replaced the simple binary search with a combination of a galloping search (also known as exponential search) and a binary search. The galloping search quickly narrows down the potential range where the group boundary lies. Following this, a binary search is performed on this much smaller range to precisely identify the end of the group. This hybrid strategy is significantly more efficient for datasets characterized by numerous small groups, as it drastically reduces the number of comparisons required.
