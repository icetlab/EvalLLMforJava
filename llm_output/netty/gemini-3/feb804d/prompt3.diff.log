My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the scheduling and cancellation of tasks in `AbstractScheduledEventExecutor`. The key improvements are:

1.  **Avoiding unnecessary work for cancelled tasks**: When a task is scheduled from outside the event loop and cancelled shortly after, the current implementation still enqueues a command to add it to the scheduled task queue, and another to remove it. I'll add a check to prevent adding an already-cancelled task to the queue, which saves both an add and a remove operation on the priority queue. This primarily benefits scenarios with high rates of task scheduling and cancellation from external threads.

2.  **Reducing allocation during bulk cancellation**: The `cancelScheduledTasks` method currently converts the entire scheduled task queue to an array before iterating over it to cancel tasks. For a large number of scheduled tasks, this creates significant garbage collection pressure. I will change this to use an iterator, avoiding the intermediate array allocation.

3.  **Improving code style and micro-optimizations**: I will replace an anonymous inner class implementation of a `Comparator` with a more concise and potentially more efficient method reference.

These changes will improve performance by reducing object allocations and eliminating redundant operations, especially under high load.
