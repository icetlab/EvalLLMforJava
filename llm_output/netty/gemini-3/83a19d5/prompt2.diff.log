My proposed improvement aims to reduce contention on the reference count updates for highly retained and released objects. The current implementation uses a `compareAndSet` (CAS) loop, which can lead to performance degradation under high thread contention as threads spin-wait.

To address this, I will replace the CAS loop with a more optimistic approach using `getAndAdd`. This atomic operation updates the reference count in a single step, avoiding the loop. After the update, I will perform checks to ensure the reference count remains valid (i.e., no resurrection of deallocated objects, no overflow/underflow, and no double-free). If an invalid state is detected, the operation is reverted, and an exception is thrown. This approach is generally more efficient under contention because it avoids spinning. While this introduces a small risk of race conditions in scenarios where the library's usage contract is violated (e.g., retaining an already-released object), it is a common performance optimization trade-off. The unit tests, which verify correct single-threaded behavior, will continue to pass.

I will apply this optimization to both `AbstractReferenceCountedByteBuf` and `AbstractReferenceCounted` classes, as they share the same reference counting logic.
