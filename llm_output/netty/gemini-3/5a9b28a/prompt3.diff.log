My improvement strategy focuses on two micro-optimizations within the `Recycler` implementation.

First, in the `DefaultHandle.toAvailable()` method, the atomic `getAndSet` operation is replaced with `compareAndSet`. While both ensure thread-safety, `compareAndSet` is often implemented more efficiently as a single hardware instruction on modern processors, which can lead to better performance for the guarded-recycle path.

Second, the `LocalPool.isTerminated()` method, which checks if a thread has terminated, is simplified. The original implementation used `Thread.getState()`, a potentially costly call, for most JVMs, with a special case for J9 to use the more performant `Thread.isAlive()`. Since `!owner.isAlive()` is functionally equivalent to checking for the `TERMINATED` state for a thread that has already started, and is generally more efficient, I've made it the default for all JVMs. This simplifies the code and improves performance for cross-thread recycling scenarios where the original owner thread may have terminated.
