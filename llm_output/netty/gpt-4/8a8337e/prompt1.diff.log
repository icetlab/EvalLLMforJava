Iâ€™ve refined the search pattern to exactly match the indentation of `toAvailable()` and replaced the full method body with a CAS-based transition that avoids the extra atomic write.

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "../netty/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/Recycler.java",
    "search": "        void toAvailable() {\n            int prev = STATE_UPDATER.getAndSet(this, STATE_AVAILABLE);\n            if (prev == STATE_AVAILABLE) {\n                throw new IllegalStateException(\"Object has been recycled already.\");\n            }\n        }",
    "replace": "        void toAvailable() {\n            // Use a single CAS to transition from CLAIMED to AVAILABLE and detect double-recycle\n            if (!STATE_UPDATER.compareAndSet(this, STATE_CLAIMED, STATE_AVAILABLE)) {\n                throw new IllegalStateException(\"Object has been recycled already.\");\n            }\n        }"
  }
]
```
