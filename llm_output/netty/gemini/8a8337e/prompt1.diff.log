My overall improvement strategy focuses on two micro-optimizations within the `Recycler` class to enhance its performance in high-contention scenarios.

First, I will refactor the `get()` method to better support Java JIT compiler optimizations. The current implementation uses a single `if-else` block for both the fast path (retrieving an object from the pool) and the slow path (allocating a new object). By restructuring the code to handle the fast path with an early return, we can improve branch prediction and potentially enable method inlining for the most common execution path.

Second, I will optimize the `DefaultHandle.toAvailable()` method, which is called when an object is recycled. The original implementation uses `getAndSet`, a strong atomic operation. I will replace it with `compareAndSet`, which is generally a lighter and faster operation on modern hardware. This change is safe because the state transition is predictable, and it maintains the necessary thread-safety for detecting double-recycling attempts.

These changes preserve the original functionality and are validated by the existing unit tests.
