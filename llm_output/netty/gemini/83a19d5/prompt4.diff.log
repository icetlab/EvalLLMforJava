The performance of reference counting can be improved under high contention by replacing `compareAndSet` with `weakCompareAndSet`. The current implementation uses a `compareAndSet` (CAS) operation within a spin loop. While correct, this can be inefficient on some hardware when many threads are contending for the same reference count, as `compareAndSet` often maps to a heavy, locked CPU instruction.

`weakCompareAndSet` is a lighter-weight alternative that can fail spuriously but is generally faster under contention on certain architectures. Since the reference counting logic is already inside a retry loop, these spurious failures are handled correctly by re-reading the count and trying the update again. This change can lead to better throughput and lower CPU usage in highly concurrent scenarios by reducing contention-related overhead.
