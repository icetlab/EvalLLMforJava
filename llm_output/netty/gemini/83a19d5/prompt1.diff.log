My proposed improvement focuses on optimizing the most frequently used reference counting operations: `retain()` and `release()` with a default increment/decrement of 1.

The current implementation delegates these calls to generic `retain0(int)` and `release0(int)` methods. While this is good for code reuse, it can introduce method call overhead, which can be significant in performance-critical code. Additionally, modern Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers can perform better optimizations on inlined code.

My change inlines the logic for the default `retain()` and `release()` operations directly into the methods. This eliminates the method call overhead and provides a better opportunity for the JIT compiler to optimize these hot paths. The inlined logic is a direct specialization of the generic methods for an increment/decrement of 1, ensuring correctness and preserving all original checks for resurrection, overflow, and underflow. These changes are applied to both `AbstractReferenceCountedByteBuf` and the generic `AbstractReferenceCounted` classes for consistency.
