My overall improvement strategy is to optimize header lookups in the HPACK static table.

Specifically, in `HpackStaticTable.getIndexInsensitive`, the current implementation performs a linear scan that can continue to the end of the table even after it's clear no match will be found. I will modify this loop to terminate early as soon as it moves past the block of headers with the same name, which is possible because headers with the same name are grouped together in the static table. This change will reduce unnecessary comparisons, especially for headers that have multiple values in the static table but none of them match the provided value.

    "search": "        // Note this assumes all entries for a given header field are sequential.\n        while (index <= length) {\n            HpackHeaderField entry = getEntry(index);\n            if (equalsVariableTime(name, entry.name) && equalsVariableTime(value, entry.value)) {\n                return index;\n            }\n            index++;\n        }",
    "replace": "        // Note this assumes all entries for a given header field are sequential.\n        for (; index <= length; index++) {\n            HpackHeaderField entry = getEntry(index);\n            if (!equalsVariableTime(name, entry.name)) {\n                break;\n            }\n            if (equalsVariableTime(value, entry.value)) {\n                return index;\n            }\n        }"
