My overall improvement strategy is to optimize the `PromiseTask` class, which is a key component in the scheduling mechanism benchmarked. The primary goal is to reduce the overhead within the `runTask()` method by eliminating a conditional check (`instanceof`).

This is achieved by ensuring the internal `task` object is always a `java.util.concurrent.Callable`. For tasks that are originally `java.lang.Runnable`, they are wrapped into a `Callable` using an adapter. This refactoring simplifies the `runTask()` implementation to a direct method call, which can be more efficiently handled by the JIT compiler. This change benefits scenarios with a high volume of scheduled tasks, particularly those that are `Callable` instances, as seen in the provided benchmarks.

The changes include:
1.  Converting sentinel markers for task completion states from `Runnable` to `Callable`.
2.  Changing the `task` field's type from `Object` to `Callable<V>`.
3.  Updating `PromiseTask` constructors to wrap `Runnable` instances into `Callable`s.
4.  Simplifying the `runTask()` method to directly invoke `call()` on the `task` field.
5.  Adjusting the `clearTaskAfterCompletion()` helper method to work with the new `Callable`-based sentinels.

These modifications are all contained within `PromiseTask.java` and are designed to improve performance while preserving existing functionality.
