My analysis indicates that the `writeUtf8` method, specifically the fast-path implementation `writeUtf8(AbstractByteBuf buffer, int writerIndex, CharSequence seq, int len)`, can be optimized. Currently, it processes characters one by one in a single loop with multiple conditional branches, which is not ideal for strings that are predominantly ASCII.

I will introduce an optimization that adds a dedicated "fast-path" loop to handle the common case of leading ASCII characters in the input `CharSequence`. This initial loop will be very simple and fast, iterating through the sequence and writing bytes as long as they are within the ASCII range. If the entire string is ASCII, this is the only loop that will run.

If a non-ASCII character is encountered, the code will then fall back to a second loop, which contains the original, more complex logic for handling multi-byte UTF-8 characters and surrogates. This second loop will pick up from where the fast-path loop left off.

This "fast-path / slow-path" pattern is a common and effective performance optimization technique. It improves performance for the most frequent scenario (ASCII text) by reducing branching and simplifying the logic inside the hot loop, while correctly handling all cases.
