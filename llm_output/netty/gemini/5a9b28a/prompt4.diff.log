The overall improvement is to change the thread-local object cache from a FIFO queue to a LIFO stack. This is achieved by changing the `pollFirst()` call on the `ArrayDeque` to `pollLast()`. This change improves performance due to better cache locality. By reusing the most recently recycled objects first, which are more likely to be present in CPU caches, we can expect a reduction in cache misses and thus better performance. This is a common optimization for object pools. The change preserves the existing functionality and passes all unit tests.

    "replace": "            if (batch.isEmpty()) {\n                handles.drain(this, chunkSize);\n            }\n            DefaultHandle<T> handle = batch.pollLast();"
  }
