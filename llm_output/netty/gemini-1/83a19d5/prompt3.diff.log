My improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the most common reference counting operations: `retain()` and `release()` (which increment/decrement by 1). The original implementation delegated these calls to generic `retain0(int)` and `release0(int)` methods.

By inlining the logic for the increment/decrement of 1 directly into the `retain()` and `release()` methods, we can achieve a performance gain. This specialization has two main benefits:
1.  It eliminates the overhead of a method call for these frequent operations.
2.  It replaces the generic and somewhat obscure checks in `retain0` (e.g., `nextCnt <= increment`) with explicit, constant-based checks (e.g., `refCnt == 0` and `refCnt == Integer.MAX_VALUE`). This specialized code is more amenable to JIT compiler optimizations, such as better branch prediction, leading to faster execution, especially in highly contended scenarios as targeted by the benchmark.

These changes are applied consistently to both `AbstractReferenceCounted` and `AbstractReferenceCountedByteBuf` to ensure the performance benefits are realized across all reference-counted objects in Netty.
