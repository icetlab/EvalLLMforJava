My overall improvement is to optimize the class initialization of `HpackStaticTable`. The `maxSameNameFieldIndex()` method is executed only once when the class is loaded to compute a value that is constant as long as the static table itself doesn't change. By pre-calculating this value and hardcoding it, we can avoid the computation cost during class loading and remove the now-unnecessary method. This makes the initialization slightly faster and the class simpler.
