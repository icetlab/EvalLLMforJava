My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing the scheduling and cancellation of tasks, particularly when these actions are initiated from outside the event loop thread.

The primary optimization involves modifying `AbstractScheduledEventExecutor`. When a task is scheduled from an external thread, it is not immediately added to the priority queue but is instead enqueued as a work item for the event loop to process. If this task is cancelled before the event loop adds it to the scheduled task queue, the current implementation still performs the addition and then a subsequent removal. My change introduces a check to see if the task has been cancelled before adding it to the queue. This avoids both the unnecessary addition and removal operations, significantly improving performance for scenarios with frequent schedule-then-cancel patterns, as highlighted by the `scheduleCancelLotsOutsideLoop` benchmark.

Additionally, I've updated the `SCHEDULED_FUTURE_TASK_COMPARATOR` to use a more modern and concise lambda expression instead of an anonymous inner class. This is a minor code-style and potential performance improvement.

These changes preserve the original functionality and are validated by the existing unit tests.
