The current implementation uses a thread-local `ArrayDeque` as a batch cache for recycled objects. It uses `addLast` to add objects and `pollFirst` to retrieve them, effectively making it a FIFO queue. For object recycling, a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) strategy is generally more performant due to better CPU cache locality. Objects that were recently used and recycled are more likely to still be in the CPU's caches.

To improve performance, I will change the retrieval method from `pollFirst` to `pollLast`. This will change the behavior of the batch cache from FIFO to LIFO, as objects are added with `addLast` and will now be retrieved with `pollLast`. This simple change is expected to improve performance by increasing the chances of cache hits when retrieving objects from the recycler.
