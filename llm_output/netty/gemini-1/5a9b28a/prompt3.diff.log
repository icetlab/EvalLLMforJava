My analysis of the `Recycler` class indicates that performance can be improved in scenarios involving cross-thread object recycling.

The `LocalPool.isTerminated(Thread)` method is called during cross-thread recycling to check if the owner thread of a `LocalPool` has terminated. This is crucial for preventing memory leaks by cleaning up resources associated with dead threads.

The current implementation of `isTerminated` uses `Thread.getState()`, which can be a relatively expensive operation on some JVMs like J9. While it uses the faster `Thread.isAlive()` on J9, it relies on `getState()` for other JVMs. However, `!owner.isAlive()` is functionally equivalent to `owner.getState() == Thread.State.TERMINATED` for a thread that has already been started, which is always the case for a `LocalPool`'s owner. The `isAlive()` check is known to be very fast across all major JVMs.

By changing `isTerminated` to use `!owner.isAlive()` unconditionally, we can avoid the potentially costly `getState()` call, thereby improving performance for cross-thread recycling operations. This change also simplifies the code by removing the JVM-specific conditional logic.
