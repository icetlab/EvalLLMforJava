My overall improvement strategy is to enhance the performance of UTF-8 encoding operations by removing `try-catch` blocks from hot loops. Using explicit boundary checks instead of relying on exception handling for control flow avoids the significant overhead associated with creating and handling exceptions, which is particularly beneficial in performance-sensitive code that frequently processes character sequences.
