My analysis of `NetUtil.getIPv6ByName()` reveals a significant performance bottleneck in its final stage, where it handles IP address compression (`::`) and IPv4-to-IPv6 mapping. The existing implementation uses nested loops to shift parts of a byte array one byte at a time. This approach is highly inefficient, exhibiting quadratic complexity relative to the number of bytes to be shifted.

My proposed improvement replaces this complex and slow shifting logic with two standard, highly-optimized Java library calls: `System.arraycopy()` and `java.util.Arrays.fill()`.

1.  `System.arraycopy()` is used to move the block of bytes representing the part of the IP address after a compression sequence (or the entire IPv4 address) to its correct final position in the 16-byte array. This is a native, heavily optimized operation.
2.  `java.util.Arrays.fill()` is then used to efficiently zero-out the gap created by the move, which represents the compressed zeros in an IPv6 address.

This change simplifies the code, removes the inefficient nested loops, and leverages optimized JVM intrinsics, which will substantially improve the performance of parsing compressed IPv6 addresses and IPv4-mapped addresses, directly addressing the performance issue. The change is designed to be functionally equivalent to the original logic while being much more performant.
