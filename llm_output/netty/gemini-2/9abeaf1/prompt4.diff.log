The performance issue is related to the wakeup logic in `EpollEventLoop`, which is described as overly complex. The current implementation uses an `AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater` (`wakenUp`) to guard against unnecessary `eventFd` writes, but includes a complex and potentially inefficient workaround for a race condition. This workaround involves an extra `eventFdWrite` syscall, which can be costly.

My improvement simplifies this logic by removing the workaround. The race condition, where a wakeup might be missed, is already handled by existing logic within the `epollWait` method. Specifically, the check `if (oldWakeup && hasTasks())` ensures that if a wakeup was signaled (`oldWakeup`) and there are tasks pending (`hasTasks`), the event loop will not block, but instead perform a non-blocking poll. This makes the extra wakeup call redundant.

By removing the block of code that performs the second `eventFdWrite` and its accompanying explanatory comment, the code becomes simpler and more performant by avoiding an unnecessary syscall in certain race scenarios.
