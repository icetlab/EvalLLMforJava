My overall improvement strategy focuses on optimizing hot paths within the `Recycler` to reduce overhead.

First, I've simplified the `isTerminated` check to always use `Thread.isAlive()`. This method is generally faster than `Thread.getState()` across various JVMs, not just on J9 where `getState()` is known to have performance issues. This change reduces the cost of checking if a thread has terminated.

Second, I've refactored the `release` method in the `LocalPool` class. The original implementation performed a redundant `isTerminated` check when an object was recycled on its owner thread with a full local batch. The new logic separates same-thread and foreign-thread recycling paths, eliminating this unnecessary check and making the code's intent clearer.

These changes preserve the existing functionality and are aimed at improving the performance of object recycling, especially in multi-threaded scenarios.
