The overall performance improvement strategy focuses on optimizing UTF-8 string handling, which is a common and performance-sensitive operation.

First, I've identified `try-catch` blocks within tight loops in the `writeUtf8` and `utf8Bytes` methods. These blocks handle surrogate pair processing at the end of a `CharSequence`. Exception handling, even when an exception is not thrown, can hinder JIT compiler optimizations. I've replaced these `try-catch` blocks with explicit boundary checks, which are more efficient and achieve the same logic.

Second, the `isUtf8` validation method has been enhanced with a fast-path for ASCII characters. For input that is predominantly ASCII, the method can now quickly determine validity without entering the more complex multi-byte character validation logic. This is achieved by using the existing `forEachByte` with `FIND_NON_ASCII` processor to quickly scan for the first non-ASCII character before proceeding with the detailed validation from that point.

These changes improve performance by reducing overhead in critical loops and adding efficient fast-paths for common cases, all while preserving the original functionality and correctness.
