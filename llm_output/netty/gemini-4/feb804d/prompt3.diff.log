My optimization strategy focuses on scenarios where a scheduled task is cancelled shortly after its creation, especially from a non-event-loop thread. In such cases, the original code would enqueue a task to be added to the `PriorityQueue` and another to remove it. My change introduces a check for cancellation right before adding the task to the `PriorityQueue`. If the task is already cancelled, the expensive queue insertion (and the corresponding removal) is skipped, leading to a significant performance improvement in cancellation-heavy workloads. This optimization adds a negligible overhead of a single volatile read in the non-cancelled case.
