My overall improvement strategy focuses on two micro-optimizations within the `Recycler` implementation.

First, I will change the atomic operation in `DefaultHandle.toAvailable()` from `getAndSet` to `compareAndSet`. The `compareAndSet` operation more directly expresses the intended state transition and can be more efficient, especially in contended scenarios or on certain hardware, as it avoids a memory write if the state is not the expected value. This is a common pattern for state machine transitions in high-performance concurrent code.

Second, I will simplify the `isTerminated(Thread)` check in `LocalPool`. The current implementation uses a conditional check for J9 VMs versus other JVMs. By using `!owner.isAlive()`, we can unify this logic. This is safe because the `owner` thread is always a started thread, meaning `!isAlive()` is equivalent to its state being `TERMINATED`. This change removes a platform-dependent check and uses a generally more efficient method than `Thread.getState()`, which should improve performance on the cross-thread recycling path when a thread has terminated.
