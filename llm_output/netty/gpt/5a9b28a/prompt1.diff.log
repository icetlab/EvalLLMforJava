Overall improvement intent:
Simplify and accelerate the thread-termination check in the release path by avoiding the JVM-type branch and the costly Thread.getState() callâ€”using Thread.isAlive() directly to detect termination.

    "replace": "private static boolean isTerminated(Thread owner) {\n            // Simplified termination check: use isAlive only\n            return !owner.isAlive();\n        }"
