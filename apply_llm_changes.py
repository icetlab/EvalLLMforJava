# Counting is hard for LLMs. Instead of having it generate diffs directly, tell it to output the old code block before the edit, then write a program that converts that to a diff by finding the original block in the code file.
# The trick is really to forget about the ai knowing why lines itâ€™s adding and removing, and focus on the chunks of code it wants to change.
